/**
 * Typed loader errors that SSR pipelines translate into HTTP semantics.
 *
 * The `ssr-data-plugin` and `rsc-server-plugin` are intentionally
 * HTTP-agnostic — they only await the loader and write the resolved value
 * to `state.context.<namespace>`. Loaders bridge to HTTP status codes by
 * throwing one of these named errors; application-layer middleware catches
 * them and maps each `code` to the right status (302/308, 404, 504).
 *
 * Structural discrimination via `code` (not `instanceof`) so consumers
 * can match across realms / bundle boundaries without coupling to the
 * class identity.
 *
 * Re-exported from both plugins under the `./errors` subpath:
 * `@real-router/ssr-data-plugin/errors` and
 * `@real-router/rsc-server-plugin/errors`.

/**
 * Race a loader against a deadline, with cooperative cancellation.
 *
 * The loader is invoked with `{ signal }` — a composed `AbortSignal` that
 * aborts on the first of:
 * - the deadline elapsing (`internalController.abort()` fires synchronously
 *   *before* the race rejects with `LoaderTimeout`, so a loader that
 *   threads `signal` into its I/O — e.g. `fetch(url, { signal })` — can
 *   actually cancel the underlying work);
 * - `options.upstreamSignal` aborting (typically the request-scoped abort
 *   wired by `cloneRouter(base, { abortSignal })` for client-disconnect).
 *
 * Composition uses `AbortSignal.any([upstream, internal])` (Node 20.3+).
 * If `upstreamSignal` is already aborted at call time, the loader is *not*
 * invoked and the timer is *not* started — the rejection mirrors
 * `upstreamSignal.reason ?? new DOMException("Aborted", "AbortError")`.
 *
 * On deadline, the same `LoaderTimeout` instance is used as both the
 * `signal.reason` and the rejection reason — they refer to one object.
 * On upstream abort during execution, the race rejects with the loader's
 * own error (typically `AbortError`), *not* `LoaderTimeout`.
 *
 * Cancellation is cooperative: loaders that don't propagate `signal` into
 * their I/O still run to completion in the background — the race result
 * is unaffected, but resources are not freed early.
 *
 * The `setTimeout` handle is cleared via `.finally()` on the work promise
 * so a fast-path success doesn't leak it. `Promise.race`'s internal
 * `Promise.resolve(p).then(resolve, reject)` consumes any late losing
 * rejection — no `unhandledRejection` for late loader settlements.
 *
 * Requires Node 20.3+ for `AbortSignal.any`.
 *
 * ### `ms` corner cases (Node `setTimeout` clamping)
 *
 * `ms` is forwarded verbatim to `setTimeout`, which means `Infinity`, `NaN`,
 * and negative values are **NOT** safe sentinels for "no deadline":
 *
 * - `withTimeout("r", Infinity, …)` — Node clamps to `1` ms and emits a
 *   `TimeoutOverflowWarning`. The race rejects with `LoaderTimeout` after
 *   1 ms, not "never". Use a separate code path (e.g. invoke the loader
 *   directly without wrapping) when you genuinely want no deadline.
 * - `withTimeout("r", NaN, …)` — same: Node clamps to `1` ms with a
 *   warning.
 * - `withTimeout("r", -1, …)` — Node clamps to `1` ms with a warning.
 * - `withTimeout("r", 0, …)` — fires on the next tick. A synchronous-
 *   resolving loader (`() => Promise.resolve(v)`) typically wins the race,
 *   but any async I/O loses. Treat `0` as "fire immediately" rather than
 *   "no deadline".
 *
 * No runtime guard is added — the clamping is a Node-level concern and
 * adding `if (!Number.isFinite(ms) || ms < 0) throw` would be a breaking
 * change for callers relying on the current clamp semantics.
