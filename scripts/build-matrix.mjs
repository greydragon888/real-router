//
// Reads turbo's affected-package set for the current PR, classifies each package
// by architectural layer, and emits either:
//   • mode=leaf    — small, non-core PR → keep the monolithic `pipeline` job, OR
//   • mode=sharded — full/near-full rebuild → a dynamic GHA matrix of parallel
//                    shards (base + adapters + plugin groups).
//
// It is the SINGLE source of architectural truth for the matrix: a new package
// is classified automatically from its deps/symlinks — zero `ci.yml` diff.
//
// Wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: the `check` job runs
//   node scripts/build-matrix.mjs >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
// and the leaf / base / sharded jobs branch on `mode` + consume `matrix` /
// `leaf_filter` (the explicit leaf execution filter — see buildPlan).

// TWO package sets, two turbo calls — do NOT collapse them (A5 + #1067):
//
// 1. ROUTING (leaf vs sharded) — `deriveAffected(runAffectedQuery())`, the NATIVE
//    `turbo query affected … --packages` TARGET set (changed + dependents). 🔴 A5:
//    this MUST NOT carry the dependency-closure, or `touchesCore` is always true
//    and `mode=leaf` never fires (proven on an rx-only commit, companion §D).
//    Explicit `--base origin/master --head HEAD` also fixes the bare-`--affected`
//    footgun (its auto-detected base is `main`, but this repo is on `master`).
//
// 2. MEMBERSHIP (which packages become shards) — `deriveMembership(runMembership
//    Query())`, the INPUT-AWARE `turbo run … --filter='...[origin/master]'
//    --dry=json` set. #1067: the query-affected TARGET set walks only the
//    DECLARED-dep graph, so a `shared/*` edit reaching consumers via symlink +
//    `../../shared/**` input-glob surfaces NONE of them → a shared PR sharded an
//    empty matrix and skipped its consumers while CI stayed green. The dry-run
//    graph is built from task INPUTS, so it DOES see them. The A5 closure caveat
//    is why this set feeds MEMBERSHIP only, never ROUTING.

/**
 * Decide leaf vs sharded and, if sharded, emit the matrix include[].

 * TWO package sets, because they answer two different questions (#1067):
 *   • `affected` — the ROUTING set from `turbo query affected --packages` (the
 *     declared-dep target set). It decides leaf vs sharded and must NOT carry the
 *     dependency-closure (A5), or `touchesCore` is always true and leaf never
 *     fires. It is blind to shared-source consumers (they depend on shared/* only
 *     via symlink + input-glob, not a declared dep) — that is fine for routing
 *     (touchesSharedSources still forces sharded), but WRONG for membership.
 *   • `membership` — the MEMBERSHIP set (default: `affected`). In production it is
 *     the INPUT-AWARE `...[origin/master]` set, which turbo derives from task
 *     inputs (`../../shared/**`) and therefore DOES include shared-source
 *     consumers. The shards are built from this set so a shared-source PR actually
 *     validates the adapters / url-plugins / ssr-plugins it invalidates. Deriving
 *     shards from `affected` instead is the #1067 bug: a shared PR shards nothing.
 *
 * Leaf: `affected.length <= K && !touchesCore && !touchesAdapterShared &&
 * !touchesSharedSources`. The matrix is still a VALID but empty `{ include: [] }`
 * — an empty string would make `fromJson('')` crash the workflow parse even when
 * the sharded job's `if:` is false (companion C1).
 *
 * Sharded: each adapter is its own shard (1 adapter = 1 shard, R2.10); the other
 * non-empty groups become one shard each. `base` is handled by a separate job,
 * so it is never in `include`. Empty groups are omitted → GHA spawns no runner.
 *
 * `leafFilter` (leaf only, else "") is the explicit `--filter=<pkg>` set the
 * pipeline-leaf job runs INSTEAD of `--filter='...[origin/master]'`. The git-ref
 * filter treats a root-file change (pnpm-lock.yaml, root tsconfig) as touching
 * EVERY workspace, so a Dependabot lockfile bump — routed here as a 1-package
 * leaf — would still execute the whole-repo graph; with Remote Cache off in the
 * Dependabot context (repo secrets are withheld) that graph runs COLD (~8m vs
 * ~2m). `query affected --packages` (this set) attributes the root lockfile to
 * the actually-affected package, so leaf EXECUTION scope matches the ROUTING
 * decision. Empty only on a root-config PR touching zero packages; pipeline-leaf
 * falls back to the git-ref filter there (which yields zero tasks on such a PR).
 *
 * @param {string[]} affected routing set (query-affected, packages/* only)
 * @param {Map<string,string>} dirOf name→directory (routing + membership merged)
 * @param {string[]} [membership] input-aware shard-membership set (default: affected)
