# SSR Svelte Example

> Real-Router with classical Svelte 5 SSR — `svelte/server.render` + `<svelte:head>` over Express + Vite.

## What This Demonstrates

- **`@real-router/ssr-data-plugin` for critical data** — `state.context.data` resolves before render, identical contract to React/Vue/Solid
- **`svelte/server.render(App, { props })`** — sync if no top-level `await`, async (`PromiseLike` resolves) when components contain `await` expressions or `<svelte:boundary pending>`
- **`svelte.hydrate(App, { target, props })`** — separate function in Svelte 5. **`mount(App, { hydrate: true })` does NOT exist** in Svelte 5 (that was the deprecated Svelte 4 compat surface via `asClassComponent`)
- **`head` injection** — `RenderOutput.head` carries `<svelte:head>` content from rendered components; the server splices it into the `<!--ssr-head-->` placeholder ahead of the body
- **Per-request `cloneRouter()`** — guard plugins (`canActivate`) read deps via `cloneRouter(base, { currentUser })`, identical to other adapters
- **`@real-router/browser-plugin` only on the client** — never registered in `entry-server.ts` (it touches `globalThis.history`/`window.location`)
- **Snippet-based `RouteView`** — Svelte 5 named snippets matching route segments. `notFound` and `self` are reserved slot names
- **Loader-driven HTTP semantics** — typed loader errors (`LoaderRedirect`, `LoaderNotFound`, `LoaderTimeout` from `@real-router/ssr-data-plugin/errors`) are caught by `renderPage()` and mapped to `301/302`, `404`, and `504` responses respectively. `users.profile` throws `LoaderNotFound` for unknown ids → 404 (vs `UNKNOWN_ROUTE` which is a 200 + NotFound page). `legacyUser` (`/legacy-user/:id`) throws `LoaderRedirect("/users/:id", 301)` — the canonical-URL pattern. `slow` (`/slow`) demonstrates `withTimeout()` racing a 250 ms budget so the response stays under the deadline (504 instead of hanging an SSR worker); the composed `AbortSignal` (#598) aborts the upstream `fetch` at the network layer when the deadline elapses, freeing server resources cooperatively (see "Production HTTP semantics" below). `boom` (`/boom`) rejects with a generic `Error` (no `code`) — falls through to the 500 `<server-error>` body, the untyped-rejection path. Typed errors were hoisted from per-example `_loader-errors.ts` files into the package in commit `e7ad413e` (issue #594).
- **`createSubscriber` (Svelte 5 reactive primitive)** — `src/utils/clock.svelte.ts` wraps a `setInterval` subscription via `createSubscriber` and exposes a reactive accessor. SSR ships the server's initial timestamp; after hydration the subscriber sets up the interval lazily (only when read inside an effect/template) and Svelte updates the DOM each tick. The canonical Svelte 5 way to integrate `subscribe(callback)` APIs (websocket, IntersectionObserver, MediaQueryList) into the reactivity graph — analogous to React's `useSyncExternalStore` and Solid's `createResource`. Exercised on the home page.
- **`SvelteSet` (reactive Set wrapper)** — `UsersList.svelte` uses `new SvelteSet<string>()` for selection state. Mutations via `.add()` / `.delete()` notify the reactivity graph so `selected.size` re-renders without immutable replacement. Same family as `SvelteMap`, `SvelteDate`, `SvelteURL`, `SvelteURLSearchParams`. Client-only state — never serialized to SSR (selection starts empty after hydration regardless of server).

## Architecture

```
server/
  _auth.ts            Re-exports parseCookieHeader + lookupUserFromCookies
                      from src/_known-users.ts (server-side cookie → CurrentUser)
  dev.ts              Express + Vite dev middleware (HMR); mirrors Cache-Control
                      + AbortController wiring, no ETag in dev
  index.ts            Express production server (sha256 ETag, Cache-Control,
                      AbortController per request)
src/
  _known-users.ts     KNOWN_USERS table + parseCookieHeader + lookupUserFromCookies
                      Shared between server/_auth.ts and entry-client.ts so
                      post-hydration `canActivate(getDep("currentUser"))` sees
                      the same DI value as the SSR pass — otherwise client-side
                      guard checks would diverge from the SSR snapshot
  database.ts         In-memory mock store (id "9999" intentionally absent —
                      used by LoaderNotFound demos)
  entry-server.ts     renderPage(url, ctx) → { html, head, serializedData,
                      statusCode, redirect, rawBody?, contentType? }
  entry-client.ts     hydrateRouter() + svelte.hydrate() with browser-plugin
                      + ssr-data-plugin
  App.svelte          Snippet-based RouteView shell (server + client)
  router/
    routes.ts         Route definitions with auth + role guards (incl.
                      /slow, /legacy-user/:id, /boom)
    loaders.ts        Per-route data loaders (typed errors via
                      @real-router/ssr-data-plugin/errors)
    cache-policies.ts getCachePolicy(path) → Cache-Control header value
    createAppRouter.ts  Router factory that forwards deps to createRouter()
  utils/
    clock.svelte.ts   createSubscriber demo (SSR-safe + reactive interval
                      after hydration)
  pages/
    Home, UsersList, UserProfile, UserPosts, Dashboard, Admin,
    NotFound (.svelte)
```

### SSR Flow

```
Server (per request):
  cloneRouter(base, { currentUser })
    → usePlugin(ssrDataPluginFactory(loaders))
    → start(url)                                   # critical data resolved
    → await render(App, { props: { router } })     # PromiseLike covers sync + async paths
    → { head, body, hashes }                       # head includes <svelte:head> contributions
    → serializeRouterState(state) → __SSR_STATE__
    → cleanup() (router.dispose() in finally)

Client (initial hydration):
  createAppRouter({ currentUser })
    → usePlugin(browserPluginFactory(), ssrDataPluginFactory(loaders))
    → hydrateRouter(router, window.__SSR_STATE__)  # deposits parsed state in scratchpad, calls start(state.path)
                                                   # ssr-data-plugin reads context.data from scratchpad (#596) — loader skipped
    → hydrate(App, { target: #root, props: { router } })
                                                   # claims SSR'd DOM, attaches handlers
                                                   # browser-plugin handles SPA nav after this
```

**Post-hydration loader skip (#596).** `hydrateRouter()` deposits the parsed `__SSR_STATE__` into a one-shot scratchpad on `RouterInternals.hydrationState` before `router.start(state.path)`. `ssr-data-plugin`'s start interceptor reads the scratchpad and writes the server-resolved value to `state.context.data` directly, skipping the loader call. Result: zero loader-driven calls on first paint after hydration. Verified by `post-hydration loader skip (#596)` Playwright tests in [`e2e/ssr.spec.ts`](e2e/ssr.spec.ts).

## Svelte-Specific Gotchas

- **`hydrate` ≠ `mount`.** Svelte 5 ships them as separate top-level exports of `svelte`. `hydrate(App, { target, props })` claims existing DOM; `mount(App, { target, props })` mounts fresh. There is **no** `mount({ hydrate: true })` option in Svelte 5 — that's the deprecated Svelte 4 compat surface via `asClassComponent`. Mixing them produces silent mismatches that look like flicker
- **`render()` is `PromiseLike` even for sync components.** `RenderOutput = SyncRenderOutput & PromiseLike<SyncRenderOutput>` — the same call returns a sync object you can read directly *and* a thenable you can `await`. Using `await render(App, …)` covers both sync and async (top-level `await`, `<svelte:boundary pending>`) paths uniformly
- **`<svelte:head>` content lands in `RenderOutput.head`.** Components can declaratively contribute to `<head>` via `<svelte:head>` blocks; `render()` collects them into the `head` field. The server splices it through `<!--ssr-head-->` so per-page titles, meta tags, and link rels survive SSR. This is the Svelte alternative to manual `meta.ts` injection
- **Composables return `{ current: T }` getters, not `Ref`/`Accessor`.** Read inside reactive contexts (template, `$derived`, `$effect`). Reading `.current` outside a reactive scope still returns the snapshot but doesn't register a subscription
- **`getContext` must be called during component init.** All composables (`useRoute`, `useNavigator`, etc.) wrap `getContext()` and throw if called inside `$effect`, event handlers, or async callbacks. The `RouterProvider` must wrap consumers — App.svelte does this
- **`<Lazy>` ≠ SSR data.** `<Lazy>` uses `$effect` to start its loader, and `$effect` does not fire on the server — so SSR renders **only** the fallback. For SSR-critical data, use `state.context.data` (via `ssr-data-plugin`) or a top-level `await` in `<script>`
- **Snippet names must be valid JS identifiers and match route segments exactly.** `notFound` and `self` are reserved by `RouteView` (see `RESERVED_SLOT_NAMES`). Use `userProfile`, not `user-profile`. Inside a parent `<RouteView nodeName="users">`, the parent's *own* leaf renders into `self` while nested children render into snippets named after them — see `App.svelte` for the `users` → `self` (UsersList) + `profile` (UserProfile) pattern
- **Don't override Vite `resolve.conditions`.** Replacing the default list drops the implicit `"browser"` condition for the client build, and `import { hydrate } from "svelte"` resolves to `index-server.js` where `hydrate()` throws `lifecycle_function_unavailable`. Use `dedupe: ["svelte"]` only — see the inline comment in `vite.config.ts`

## Run

```bash
pnpm dev          # Express + Vite middleware (HMR), http://localhost:3000
                  # `predev` hook runs `pnpm turbo run bundle --filter=...`
                  # so workspace deps (@real-router/svelte + plugins) are
                  # rebuilt before the dev server starts — Vite reads
                  # `dist/esm/` for `@real-router/*` imports in SSR context.
pnpm build:app    # svelte-check + vite build (client + ssr bundles)
pnpm preview      # NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts
pnpm test:e2e     # Playwright
```

## Mapping Loader Errors to HTTP

`renderPage()` in `src/entry-server.ts` inspects the `code` field of any error thrown out of `router.start()`:

| Error `code`       | HTTP response                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `CANNOT_ACTIVATE`  | `302 Location: /` (auth guard rejected)      |
| `LOADER_REDIRECT`  | `301/302 Location: error.target`             |
| `LOADER_NOT_FOUND` | `404 Not Found` (text/plain)                 |
| `LOADER_TIMEOUT`   | `504 Gateway Timeout` (text/plain)           |
| anything else      | propagates → 500 with `<server-error>` body  |

Demonstrated routes:
- `/users/9999` → `LoaderNotFound("user:9999")` → 404 (id `9999` is intentionally absent from `database.ts` — any unknown id behaves the same)
- `/users/9999/posts` → leaf loader re-validates parent id → same `LoaderNotFound` path
- `/legacy-user/:id` → `LoaderRedirect(\`/users/${id}\`, 301)` → 301 + Location. Verified end-to-end: Playwright follows the 301 to confirm `/users/3` re-renders with hydrated profile data, not just that the redirect status fires
- `/slow` → 5 s loader behind 250 ms `withTimeout()` race → `LoaderTimeout` → 504. The `withTimeout` deadline now drives a composed `AbortSignal` (#598) — the loader's `signal` aborts on the deadline OR on client disconnect (`options.upstreamSignal`), and the loader's `setTimeout` is freed via the signal listener
- `/boom` → loader throws generic `Error` → falls through to the 500 `<server-error>` body (untyped-rejection path; verified by an e2e test)

Trade-offs:
- The `404`/`504` bodies are plain text rather than the SSR-rendered NotFound page. Rendering a rich 404 would require a second `render()` pass with a different URL — kept simple in this demo.
- `withTimeout()` cancellation is cooperative (#598): the loader receives `{ signal }` that aborts *before* the race rejects with `LoaderTimeout`. The composed signal includes `options.upstreamSignal` (client disconnect from per-request DI), so a single listener inside the loader frees server resources on either deadline OR client-close.

## Production HTTP semantics: ETag, Cache-Control, AbortController

`server/index.ts` adds three production-grade pieces on top of the basic SSR wiring:

- **Strong `ETag`** — sha256 of the final HTML bytes, truncated to 16 base64url chars. Identical inputs yield identical hashes; conditional GET (`If-None-Match`) returns `304 Not Modified` with an empty body. The home page includes a live clock and intentionally invalidates between requests — that's the honest signal that ETag is content-derived, not random.
- **Per-route `Cache-Control`** — `src/router/cache-policies.ts` maps URL paths to directives: `/` → `public, max-age=300, s-maxage=3600, must-revalidate`; `/users` → `public, max-age=60, must-revalidate`; `/users/:id` → `public, max-age=120, must-revalidate`; `/dashboard` and `/admin` → `private, no-store`; `/legacy-user/:id` → `public, max-age=86400` (1-day cache for the redirect itself); `/slow`, `/boom`, `/async-page`, `/form` → `no-store` (`/async-page` and `/form` are reserved policy entries — the routes themselves are not yet implemented). `Cache-Control` is set on 200/304/4xx bodies; `response.redirect()`-redirects (anon `/admin` → `/`, `/legacy-user/:id` → `/users/:id`) skip the header — see `server/index.ts`.
- **`AbortController` per request** — `req.on("close")` aborts the controller; the `slow` loader pulls the signal via `getDep("abortSignal")` and forwards it as `withTimeout(..., { upstreamSignal })`; the composed signal aborts on either the 250 ms deadline or client disconnect, and `fetch(..., { signal })` propagates the abort to the network layer (#598). Without this wiring a 5 s upstream `fetch` would hold the worker even after the client gives up. The e2e suite verifies the server releases the handler within 1 s and asserts via `/__bench/abort-count` that the upstream fetch is cancelled at the network layer. Note: `abortSignal` is a custom DI key (the `cloneRouter` deps map is `Record<string, unknown>`), so loaders consuming it need a manual `as unknown as (key) => AbortSignal | undefined` cast — see `src/router/loaders.ts` for the pattern.

These are demonstrated end-to-end by 4 dedicated tests in `e2e/ssr.spec.ts` (Cache-Control routing, 304 on identical content, ETag invalidation across requests, AbortController fast release).

## CSR-only contract is verified by network spy

The e2e suite verifies the `ssr-data-plugin` contract (intercepts `start()`, not `navigate()`) with two assertions: (1) the DOM ends up showing the "User not found" branch after a CSR click, and (2) Playwright's `page.on("request")` confirms zero new HTML/document/fetch/xhr requests during the click — the data really did NOT come from a server roundtrip.

## E2e

[`e2e/ssr.spec.ts`](e2e/ssr.spec.ts) — 43 Playwright scenarios:

- 25 baseline (per-request isolation, hydration round-trip, loaders, guards, query params, nested loaders, 404, 500, CSR navigation, `<Link>` href in no-JS mode)
- Svelte-specific: no hydration mismatch warnings (Svelte 5 emits `[svelte] hydration_*` warnings on mismatch)
- **`<svelte:head>` per-route**: home page ships per-route `<title>` + `<meta description>` in raw SSR HTML; `/users` reflects the current `?sort` param via reactive `<svelte:head>`
- **Loader-driven HTTP**: `/users/9999` → 404, `/users/9999/posts` → 404, `/legacy-user/2` → 301 + Location, `/legacy-user/3` follows to a hydrated profile, `/slow` → 504 within 2.5 s budget (5 s loader delay)
- **CSR navigate spy**: clicking a profile link triggers zero document/fetch requests; `state.context.data` stays undefined
- **Query params in `__SSR_STATE__`**: `?sort=desc` surfaces in the serialized blob
- **Mixed-guard concurrent requests**: admin / user / anon contexts × 5 routes (admin, dashboard, users, profile, posts) in parallel — each context sees only its own `currentUser`
- **Cache-Control + ETag + AbortController** (4 tests): per-route Cache-Control directives match `src/router/cache-policies.ts`; `/users` 304 on conditional GET; `/` clock invalidates ETag between requests; `/slow` releases the handler in <1 s when the client disconnects (vs the 5 s loader delay)
