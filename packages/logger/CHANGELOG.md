# logger

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#443](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/443) [`7801bad`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/7801bad69d20728a0816f4d84c42cb8fbcf30a97) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `@real-router/internal-source` export condition for monorepo-internal src resolution ([#431](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/431))

  A new scoped export condition `@real-router/internal-source` is added to the package exports. Monorepo-internal TypeScript checking (via `tsconfig.json` `customConditions`) and Vitest (via the `workspaceSourceAliases` helper) now resolve `@real-router/*` imports to their `src/*.ts` files directly — no `dist/` artifacts required.

  External consumers (Vite, Webpack, Node.js) don't recognize this scoped condition name, so they continue to resolve via `import` / `require` → `dist/` exactly as before. The `@real-router/internal-source` entry is invisible to non-monorepo tools and doesn't change published package behavior.

  This structurally eliminates the race condition that caused flaky CI type-checks ([#431](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/431)) and makes the monorepo resilient to incomplete `.d.ts` generation from tsdown + rolldown RC ([#425](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/425)).

- [#321](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/321) [`6d17481`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/6d17481a3240e041e4c5d5d12c2922744fd447d2) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Rewrite README ([#320](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/320))

  Added badges, API table, log levels matrix, Sentry and React Native use case examples.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fix: bundle internal dependencies, publish logger package
  - Make logger public as @real-router/logger
  - Bundle type-guards, route-tree, search-params into consuming packages
  - Use dts-bundle-generator for TypeScript declarations (inlines all types)
  - Update release workflow to publish logger first

  This fixes installation failures where npm couldn't resolve workspace-only packages.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial public release with full routing functionality
