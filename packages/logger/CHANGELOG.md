# logger

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fix: bundle internal dependencies, publish logger package
  - Make logger public as @real-router/logger
  - Bundle type-guards, route-tree, search-params into consuming packages
  - Use dts-bundle-generator for TypeScript declarations (inlines all types)
  - Update release workflow to publish logger first

  This fixes installation failures where npm couldn't resolve workspace-only packages.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial public release with full routing functionality
