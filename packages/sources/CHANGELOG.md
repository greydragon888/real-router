### Minor Changes

- [#218](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/218) [`72019f2`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/72019f282b6b4dc4ba8a15993e19ff0ee97e1df8) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `@real-router/sources` — framework-agnostic subscription layer for router state (#217)

  Three factory functions for UI adapter authors:
  - `createRouteStore(router)` — subscribe to all navigations
  - `createRouteNodeStore(router, nodeName)` — subscribe to specific route node
  - `createActiveRouteStore(router, routeName, params?, options?)` — track route activity
