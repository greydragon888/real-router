### Minor Changes

- [#695](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/695) [`51b993e`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/51b993e7877e2b12f4e6ca0b8078f7ab4629501f) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Fix scroll restoration not firing on browser back/forward under navigation-plugin ([#694](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/694))

  Since [#657](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/657) lifted `replace` into `TransitionMeta`, a history **traversal** (back/forward) under `navigation-plugin` now arrives with `transition.replace === true` — a traversal reuses an existing history entry, which is replace-shaped at the history level. `createScrollRestoration` evaluated its replace-skip guard _before_ the back/traverse restore branch, so every back/forward navigation was swallowed and the saved scroll position was never restored.

  Reordered the restore decision tree so `reload` and `back`/`traverse` restore branches run **before** the genuine in-place-replace skip (`router.navigate({ replace: true })`, `navigateToNotFound` still skip as before).

  Also hardened restore for a custom `scrollContainer` that mounts or lays out a few frames after the navigation settles (heavy routes): restore now re-applies the scroll across a bounded frame budget until the container exists and the position sticks, instead of a single best-effort `scrollTo` that could clamp to 0 against not-yet-laid-out content.

- [#695](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/695) [`51b993e`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/51b993e7877e2b12f4e6ca0b8078f7ab4629501f) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `scrollSpy` prop to `RouterProvider` — router-coordinated `IntersectionObserver` URL hash spy ([#575](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/575))

  New top-level `scrollSpy?: ScrollSpyOptions` prop wires `createScrollSpy(router, options)` from `shared/dom-utils/`. The URL hash tracks the topmost visible anchor as the user scrolls, syncing `state.context.url.hash` so sibling `<Link hash>` highlights re-evaluate via the standard `createActiveRouteSource` pipeline.

  ```svelte
  <RouterProvider {router} scrollSpy={{ selector: "[id]:is(h2,h3)" }}>
    <!-- Your app -->
  </RouterProvider>
  ```

  Emits a forced same-route transition with `{ hash, replace: true, force: true, hashChange: true }` — same write API as `<Link hash>` ([#532](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/532)), `replace: true` so the spy doesn't pollute history. Three anti-flicker gates (`isTransitioning`, `coolingDown` cleared on `scrollend` or 500 ms fallback, `selfEmitting`).

  Reactive via `$effect` — primitive fields (`selector`, `rootMargin`) memoised by `$derived`, so inline `scrollSpy={{ selector: "[id]" }}` doesn't thrash on re-renders; `scrollContainer` getter pulled via `untrack` (identity changes don't retrigger).

  Requires `browser-plugin` or `navigation-plugin`. Under `hash-plugin` / `memory-plugin` / no URL plugin → warn-once + NOOP. SSR / browsers without `IntersectionObserver` = NOOP.

  Behaviour identical to the React adapter — see [Scroll Spy guide](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/wiki/Scroll-Spy).

### Minor Changes

- [#658](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/658) [`5313156`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/531315635e0635f1fe98975e74d3bb0d1e14421f) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - **BREAKING CHANGE (behaviour):** scroll-restoration disambiguation under `browser-plugin` ([#658](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/658))

  `createScrollRestoration` (used by `<RouterProvider scrollRestoration>`) now disambiguates push, replace, and reload transitions under `@real-router/browser-plugin` using the portable `state.transition.replace` / `state.transition.reload` flags introduced in `@real-router/core`. Before this release the utility had no portable way to read `replace` under browser-plugin, so it called `scrollToHashOrTop` on **every** transition. After this release:
  - Programmatic replace (`navigate(..., { replace: true })`, OAuth callbacks, params canonicalization, `navigateToNotFound()`, auto-force-from-`UNKNOWN_ROUTE`) → **skip** (scroll position preserved)
  - Programmatic reload (`navigate(..., { reload: true })`) → **restore** from `sessionStorage`
  - Forward push (`<Link>` without `replace`), browser back/forward (popstate), F5 cross-document → `scrollToHashOrTop` (unchanged)

  Under `@real-router/navigation-plugin` there is no behaviour change — every existing branch (`replace` / `reload` / `traverse` / `direction === "back"`) remains active.

  Opt-out for the legacy snap-on-every-transition behaviour: `scrollRestoration={{ mode: "top" }}`.

  This release also bundles the updated `transition.replace` core field; existing code reading `state.context.navigation.navigationType` is unaffected.

  Two paired components for opt-in client/server rendering boundaries.
  Both use `$state` + `$effect` — `$effect` is browser-only, so the
  server emits the SSR-side branch (fallback for `<ClientOnly>`, children
  for `<ServerOnly>`). After hydration the rune flips and the `{#if}` /
  `{#else if}` branch swaps.

  ```svelte
  <script lang="ts">
    import { ClientOnly, ServerOnly } from "@real-router/svelte";
  </script>

  <ClientOnly>
    {#snippet children()}
      <BrowserApiWidget />
    {/snippet}
    {#snippet fallback()}
      <Skeleton />
    {/snippet}
  </ClientOnly>
  ```

  Render-time HTTP status declaration for SSR. Svelte 5-native idioms (`setContext` / `getContext`). The sink write happens at component init via `getContext`, no DOM is rendered.

  ```svelte
  <script lang="ts">
    import {
      HttpStatusProvider,
      createHttpStatusSink,
    } from "@real-router/svelte/ssr";

    const sink = createHttpStatusSink();
  </script>

  <HttpStatusProvider {sink}>
    {#snippet children()}
      <App />
    {/snippet}
  </HttpStatusProvider>

  <!-- inside NotFound.svelte -->

  ```

  Mirrors the React Stage 1 + Stage 0a roll-out ([#609](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/609) / [#610](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/610)). Svelte ships
  three new SSR-feature exports under `@real-router/svelte/ssr`:
  - `useDeferred<T>(key)` — reads the promise published by the loader at
    `state.context.ssrDataDeferred[key]`.
  - `<Await>` — `.svelte` component wrapping the native `{#await}` block
    for ergonomic deferred-payload rendering.
  - `<Streamed>` — `.svelte` component matching cross-adapter naming.

  Idiom: Native `{#await}` block + Svelte 5 runes.

  **`<ClientOnly>` / `<ServerOnly>` migrated to `/ssr`**:

  ```diff
  - import { ClientOnly, ServerOnly } from "@real-router/svelte";
  + import { ClientOnly, ServerOnly } from "@real-router/svelte/ssr";
  ```

  **Wire-format**: consumes the NDJSON-shaped `<script>__rrDefer__("key",
json)</script>` settle scripts emitted by `@real-router/ssr-data-plugin/server`'s
  `injectDeferredScripts` — server-side loaders return `defer({ critical,
deferred })` once.

  **Streaming behaviour**: no progressive HTTP-flush — 🟡 DX-only — formal
  API ready for Svelte 6+ streaming.

  **Breaking change** (pre-1.0, allowed in `minor`): `ClientOnly`/`ServerOnly`
  removed from main entry.

### Patch Changes

- [#643](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/643) [`f243451`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/f24345194efac6bd85cefed0d4de340c6cc9086c) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Guard against throwing `getAnnouncementText` in `createRouteAnnouncer` ([#628](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/628))

  A user-provided `getAnnouncementText` callback that throws was propagating
  the exception up through `router.subscribe`'s listener loop, tearing down
  sibling listeners and breaking navigation tracking elsewhere. The shared
  `resolveText` helper now wraps the callback in try/catch, logs the error
  via `console.error` with a `[real-router]` prefix, and falls through to
  the built-in resolution chain (`<h1>` textContent → `document.title` →
  route name → pathname).

  User-visible effect: a buggy custom announcer resolver no longer breaks
  router subscriptions — the announcer announces the fallback text and
  logs the underlying error so the bug surfaces in dev tools.

  Discovered during the React audit (`review-2026-05-10` §5.7, MED
  severity). Applied to `shared/dom-utils/route-announcer.ts` and the
  git-tracked Angular copy.

- [#643](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/643) [`f243451`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/f24345194efac6bd85cefed0d4de340c6cc9086c) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Fix `shallowEqual` asymmetry on disjoint-key records ([#627](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/627))

  `shallowEqual({ a: undefined }, { b: "" })` returned `true` while
  `shallowEqual({ b: "" }, { a: undefined })` returned `false`. The inner loop
  read missing keys via bracket access as `undefined` and falsely matched
  `prev[key] === undefined`. Added a `hasOwnProperty` guard mirroring React's
  own `shallowEqual` (`packages/shared/shallowEqual.js`).

  The helper is inlined from `shared/dom-utils/link-utils.ts` via the symlink
  graph, so this adapter receives the fix in lockstep with the other 5
  adapters.

  User-visible effect: `<Link routeParams={{ a: undefined }} />` no longer
  compares equal to `<Link routeParams={{ b: undefined }} />` — re-render now
  matches the documented `shallowEqual` contract (key-order-insensitive,
  `Object.is` per key).

  `<RouterProvider>` derives `srBehavior` and `srStorageKey` from `scrollRestoration` props and forwards them to `createScrollRestoration`. Mode `"manual"` renamed to `"native"` (semantic clarity — utility hands off to browser-native restore, opposite of DOM `history.scrollRestoration === "manual"`).

### Minor Changes

- [#567](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/567) [`e8f4a5c`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/e8f4a5c578f1094059d500b0f44ddd7ce788c534) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `hash` support to `<Link>` and `useIsActiveRoute` ([#532](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/532))
  - `<Link>` accepts an optional `hash?: string` prop that builds a URL with
    the fragment via the URL plugin's `router.buildUrl(name, params, { hash })`
    extension and, on click, calls the `navigateWithHash` helper. The helper
    auto-bypasses SAME_STATES (`force: true, hashChange: true`) when the same
    route is navigated to with a different fragment, so anchor-style same-path
    links update both URL and `state.context.url.hashChanged`.
  - `useIsActiveRoute(name, params, strict, ignoreQueryParams, hash?)` gains
    an optional fifth `hash` argument. When provided, the composable's
    `current` is `true` iff the route matches AND `state.context.url.hash`
    equals the requested fragment exactly — distinct hashes get distinct
    cache entries in `@real-router/sources` (see its changeset).

  `createScrollRestoration` now reads the anchor target from
  `state.context.url.hash` (decoded, populated by the URL plugins) when
  available, falling back to `globalThis.location.hash` otherwise. Removes a
  race between the adapter's commit and the browser's hash update.

  `useRoute()` now throws `"useRoute called with no active route. Did you forget to await router.start() before rendering, or is the router stopped/disposed?"` when invoked before `router.start()` resolves. The getter type narrows so `route.current.name` is direct — no `?.`, no `{#if route.current}` wrapper. `useRouteNode(name)` is unchanged.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#552](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/552) [`1e9868e`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/1e9868ef02ed8f34f809fbd8bccd2a855d9a1fe2) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `useRouteExit` and `useRouteEnter` composables ([#547](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/547))

  Svelte 5 parity with the React adapter ([#544](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/544), [#548](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/548)). Identical API surface and types; idiomatic Svelte 5 implementation uses `onDestroy` (for the leave subscription) and `$effect` (for the enter watcher), all in `.svelte.ts` files so they run inside the Svelte compiler.
  - **`useRouteExit(handler, options?)`** — wraps `router.subscribeLeave` with reentrant abort pre-check and same-route skip (default `true`). Cleanup is bound to the component via `onDestroy`.
  - **`useRouteEnter(handler, options?)`** — fires `handler` once when the component mounts as a result of a navigation. Skip-initial via `route.transition.from`, skip-same-route default. Reads from `useRoute()` (`{ route, previousRoute }: { current }`-getter pattern) inside `$effect`.

  ```svelte
  <script lang="ts">
    import { useRouteExit, useRouteEnter } from "@real-router/svelte";

    useRouteExit(async ({ signal }) => {
      await api.saveDraft(formState, { signal });
    });

    useRouteEnter(({ route, previousRoute }) => {
      analytics.track("page_enter", { route: route.name, from: previousRoute.name });
    });
  </script>
  ```

  **Handler-reactivity caveat:** Svelte composables run **once** at component init; the handler is captured at hook-call time and is not swapped between renders. To vary behavior over time, read `$state` / `$derived` **inside** the handler body. See `packages/svelte/CLAUDE.md` for details.

  Types exported: `RouteExitContext`, `RouteExitHandler`, `UseRouteExitOptions`, `RouteEnterContext`, `RouteEnterHandler`, `UseRouteEnterOptions`.

  Opt in with `<RouterProvider {router} viewTransitions>` to animate route transitions via the browser's View Transitions API. The prop is a boolean — utility is either enabled or no-op (SSR, Firefox without VT support).

  Customization is pure CSS via `::view-transition-*` pseudo-elements and `view-transition-name`. See the [View Transitions wiki page](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/wiki/View-Transitions) for patterns.

  The utility lives in `shared/dom-utils/` as `createViewTransitions(router)` — same architectural pattern as `createScrollRestoration` ([#497](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/497)).

  `RouteView` now recognises a `self` named snippet, alongside the existing
  `notFound`. The `self` snippet renders when the active route name equals the
  parent `RouteView`'s `nodeName` and no segment snippet matches.

  ```svelte
  <RouteView nodeName="users">
    {#snippet self()}
      <UsersList />
    {/snippet}
    {#snippet profile()}
      <UserProfile />
    {/snippet}
    {#snippet notFound()}
      <NotFoundPage />
    {/snippet}
  </RouteView>
  ```

  Priority: segment snippet match → `self` (active equals `nodeName`) →
  `notFound` (`UNKNOWN_ROUTE`). Like `notFound`, `self` is reserved — a route
  literally named `self` is **never** picked as a regular segment match (use a
  different snippet name if you need to render a route called `self`).

  New `scrollRestoration?: ScrollRestorationOptions` prop on `RouterProvider`. Restores scroll position on back navigation, scrolls to top or hash on push. Supports `manual` / `top` / `restore` modes and a custom scroll container.

  ```svelte
  <RouterProvider {router} scrollRestoration={{ mode: "restore" }}>
    <!-- ... -->
  </RouterProvider>
  ```

  Backed by the shared `createScrollRestoration` utility in `shared/dom-utils` — same pattern as `createRouteAnnouncer`. Direction is read from `@real-router/navigation-plugin`'s `state.context.navigation`; position is persisted across reloads via `sessionStorage` + `pagehide`.

- [#474](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/474) [`d6c1b39`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/d6c1b39e7c2b6c427be062b13ba3eb633eadc7c3) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - fix: memory leak in `useRouterTransition`/`useRouterError` via shared cached source ([#467](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/467))

  Migrated internal composables to `getTransitionSource` / `getErrorSource` from `@real-router/sources` — `useRouterTransition` previously created a fresh eager-source per mount (no WeakMap cache), leaking a router subscription on every unmount. Multiple consumers now share one router subscription.

- Updated dependencies [[`d6c1b39`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/d6c1b39e7c2b6c427be062b13ba3eb633eadc7c3), [`d6c1b39`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/d6c1b39e7c2b6c427be062b13ba3eb633eadc7c3), [`d6c1b39`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/d6c1b39e7c2b6c427be062b13ba3eb633eadc7c3)]:

### Minor Changes

- [#468](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/468) [`5dddc5c`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/5dddc5c364efa265124c217c60a04b860f8d716b) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Audit-driven hardening of @real-router/svelte ([#462](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/462))
  - **Hot path:** introduce `src/constants.ts` (`EMPTY_PARAMS`, `EMPTY_OPTIONS`) and use them as defaults in `<Link>` and `createLinkAction` to remove per-render / per-click `{}` allocations
  - **Hot path:** extract `createRouteContext` helper used by `RouterProvider` and `useRouteNode` — eliminates the per-access object allocation of the previous double-getter pattern; each consumer now gets a stable `route` / `previousRoute` view
  - **`<Lazy>`:** validate that `loader()` resolves to an object with a `default` export — silent empty renders are replaced with a clear error message; non-Error rejections are wrapped into `Error` instances; status modeled as a discriminated union
  - **`createLinkAction`:** honor `target="_blank"` on anchor elements (consistent with `<Link>`); deduplicate the navigate path between click and Enter handlers; remove `eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion` via locally-narrowed `router`
  - **`<RouteView>`:** the snippet name `notFound` is now strictly reserved for the `UNKNOWN_ROUTE` fallback — even a literal route named `notFound` will not pick the snippet as a regular segment match. Hoisted `getActiveSegment` to module scope as a pure function with `for…in` iteration and pre-computed segment prefix
  - **`<RouterErrorBoundary>`:** `onError` callbacks that throw are now caught, logged via `console.error`, and never break downstream reactivity
  - **Tests:** ~24 assertion-quality fixes across functional tests; new negative test for gotcha "previousRoute is global"; new `getActiveSegment` unit tests covering the `notFound` collision; property tests now exercise the real `dom-utils` exports instead of inline replicas
  - **Stress:** +9 stress tests in 4 new files — `lazy-loading.stress.ts`, `error-boundary.stress.ts`, `teardown-race.stress.ts`, `long-run-leak.stress.ts` (38 stress tests in 12 files total)
  - **Docs:** README/CLAUDE/ARCHITECTURE/wiki brought back in sync with the source: `RouterErrorBoundary` listed in every API table; `onError` signature documented as `(error, toRoute, fromRoute)`; example count corrected (16 examples); ARCHITECTURE.md source structure no longer references non-existent files

  Internal refactor: `dom-utils` infrastructure (tsdown config, package.json exports, docs) has been removed. Shared DOM utilities now live as bare source files in `shared/dom-utils/`, accessed through the existing `src/dom-utils` symlink (now repointed to `../../../shared/dom-utils`). The `kit.alias` indirection in `svelte.config.js` has been removed in favor of direct relative imports (`./dom-utils/index.js`, `../dom-utils/index.js`). No API changes, no bundle size difference — end users see no change.

  WCAG-compliant screen reader announcements on route change. When enabled, a visually hidden `aria-live="assertive"` region announces each navigation, and focus moves to the first `<h1>` on the new page.

  ```svelte
  <RouterProvider {router} announceNavigation>
