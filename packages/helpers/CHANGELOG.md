### Patch Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/28) [`bfd2e5a`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/bfd2e5a560fa7ab701d9f59b4ea09c3779830c83) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - fix: use @real-router/types for shared type definitions

  All packages now import types from @real-router/types instead of bundling
  their own copies. This fixes TypeScript type compatibility issues when
  using multiple @real-router packages together.

- Updated dependencies [[`bfd2e5a`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/bfd2e5a560fa7ab701d9f59b4ea09c3779830c83)]:

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [`1319fb1`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/1319fb11de379534f213da091b6c190a7b6be46b) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - fix: resolve workspace:^ dependencies to actual versions

  Previous release published packages with unresolved workspace:^ protocol
  in dependencies, causing npm install to fail. This release fixes the
  issue by using pnpm publish which correctly converts workspace references.

- Updated dependencies [[`1319fb1`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/1319fb11de379534f213da091b6c190a7b6be46b)]:
  - @real-router/core@0.2.3

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- fix: bundle internal dependencies, publish logger package
  - Make logger public as @real-router/logger
  - Bundle type-guards, route-tree, search-params into consuming packages
  - Use dts-bundle-generator for TypeScript declarations (inlines all types)
  - Update release workflow to publish logger first

  This fixes installation failures where npm couldn't resolve workspace-only packages.

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @real-router/core@0.2.2

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`5f59ef3`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/5f59ef3f72ad3f26346c0e3e821822cc4fde120c) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - fix: resolve workspace:^ dependencies correctly in published packages

  Previously, workspace:^ dependencies were published to npm as-is, causing
  installation failures. Now workspace protocols are replaced with actual
  version numbers before publishing.

- Updated dependencies [[`5f59ef3`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/5f59ef3f72ad3f26346c0e3e821822cc4fde120c)]:
