- [`044d879`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/044d8791abe009155fe7346a9d3fc5757bf92edf) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - State the boot-time guard's rule rather than its history ([#2091](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/2091))

  The comment over the array branch's `putField` explained the guard through the
  failure that motivated it, in the past tense, which `packages/core/CLAUDE.md`
  forbids in source docblocks. It also pointed at an `Object.assign` "below" that
  the file does not contain — the else branch calls `copyFields`.

  It now states the standing rule and names the code that is actually there.

### Minor Changes

- [#2101](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/2101) [`48ac003`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/48ac0035f14e7ba8ddf073b96d6df9c2acfe90fd) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - The stored value now rides one seam, so a route schema governs the href ([#1938](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1938))

  The plugin registered on **two** of core's interception points: `forwardState`,
  which builds the state's query channel, and `buildPath`, the executor that prints
  the URL. Since core [#2087](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/2087) `router.buildPath` runs the `forwardState` chain too,
  which made the second registration redundant on every door — and left it sitting
  BELOW the route-default merge, after any validating plugin had already answered.

  Measured on a router with `search-schema-plugin` in the recommended order and a
  tracked value the route's schema rejects:

  ```
  before   router.buildPath("list", {}, { q: "x" })  →  /list?page=-99&q=x
           state.path                                →  /list?q=x
           state.search                              →  { q: "x" }

  after    router.buildPath("list", {}, { q: "x" })  →  /list?q=x
  ```

  An href no navigation produces, and the `[#802](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/802)` class — an injection channel below
  the validation seam — with two first-party plugins. The `buildPath` registration
  is gone, and with it the per-navigation `#pendingRemovals` bookkeeping that
  existed only to carry a removal request from one seam to the other.

  Every documented behaviour is unchanged, measured form by form: a caller's query
  value still wins over the stored one, a declared query name spelled in the path
  bag is still ignored on `buildPath` and still refused by `navigate`, and a
  removal marker (`{ key: undefined }`) is still honoured in **either** channel —
  now by the one seam, since `mergeParams` applies it in the query bag and the
  tracked-key loop applies it in the path bag.

  `minor` rather than `patch`: a third-party plugin whose own `buildPath`
  interceptor drops the search argument no longer has this plugin re-injecting
  underneath it.

- [#2076](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/2076) [`5a672d3`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/5a672d314016f9f88e4ccb8f548f9b757dd998f2) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - The plugin's frozen surfaces read a captured `Object.freeze` ([#2073](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/2073))

  A value this package freezes at RUNTIME was frozen through the live
  `Object.freeze`, so an application that re-pointed the intrinsic after boot got
  back an object that is not frozen at all. It now reads a module-load capture.

  ⚠ Capture narrows the window from "any time after boot" to "before this module
  loads"; a shim evaluated ahead of the router still wins ([#1798](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1798)). It is robustness
  against polyfills, instrumentation, extensions and test doubles, not a security
  boundary. Module-scope constants are out of scope by the same argument — they are
  frozen before any application code can run.

### Patch Changes

- [#1995](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/1995) [`b202851`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/b202851411afb5a66af5db36d67086e5d628d195) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Deciding intrinsics are read from a module-load capture ([#1971](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1971))

  14 reads of `Object.keys` / `hasOwn` / `entries` / `values` /
  `getPrototypeOf` in this package went to the live global, where an application
  can re-point them after boot. They are now read once at module load — the
  doctrine `@real-router/core`'s `guards.ts` states, extended across the repository
  by the sweep in [#1971](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1971).

  The 14 fall into three groups, with three different consequences.

  `factory.ts` (1) derives the persisted set from the config —
  `Array.isArray(params) ? params : objectKeys(params)` — so a re-pointed `keys`
  empties it and the plugin silently persists nothing. ⚠ Only for the OBJECT form
  of the config; the array form (`persistentParamsPlugin(["lang"])`) never reaches
  that read.

  `param-utils.ts` and `plugin.ts` (10) are the per-navigation merge, all `entries`
  and `hasOwn`, where an empty answer drops the carried params instead of losing
  the set that defines them.

  `validation.ts` (3) splits again. `getPrototypeOf` is the plain-object test
  (`!== Object.prototype`, rejecting a `Date` or a `Map`) and `entries` feeds the
  `.every()` that checks each key and value — and `.every()` on an empty array is
  `true`, so a re-pointed `entries` makes the plugin ACCEPT any config it exists to
  refuse. The third, `keys`, is in a different function: it derives the names to
  test for `UNPUBLISHABLE_PARAM_KEY`, so re-pointing it skips that warning rather
  than admitting anything.

  ⚠ **What capture does NOT buy**, stated because the doctrine states it: it
  narrows the window from "any time after boot" to "before the module loads". A
  shim evaluated ahead of the module still wins ([#1798](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1798)).
  This is robustness against polyfills, RUM/APM instrumentation, browser extensions
  and test doubles — not a security boundary, since re-pointing `Object.keys`
  already requires script execution.

  No behaviour change in a healthy environment: an intrinsic nobody touched answers
  the same either way.

  The `buildPath` interceptor used to fall back to the caller's **params** bag when
  no `search` was given, on the reasoning that "the matcher then reads the query out
  of `params` (`search ?? params`), so that bag is the query source here". Core
  retired that fallback — the query string is printed from the canonical query
  channel alone — and the compensation outlived its cause.

  It was not neutral. It made `buildPath` print an href that `navigate` refuses.
  Measured, with `?lang` declared on the root path and `?mode` on the route:

  ```
  buildPath("a", { lang: "fr" })    → /a?lang=fr             navigate → throws TypeError
  buildPath("c", { mode: "dark" })  → /c?lang=en&mode=dark   navigate → throws TypeError
  buildPath("a", {}, { lang: "de" }) → /a?lang=de            navigate → /a?lang=de   (control)
  ```

  A `<Link>` rendered a URL whose click throws — the divergence class core closed
  twice ([#1552](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1552) / [#1578](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1578)), manufactured here.

  **Migration.** Pass a tracked value in the `search` argument, which is what this
  package's own docs have prescribed since [#1572](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1572): `router.buildPath("page", {},
{ lang: "fr" })`, not `router.buildPath("page", { lang: "fr" })`. The retired
  spelling is now ignored by `buildPath` exactly as core ignores it, and the stored
  value prints instead.

  Nothing changes for the supported spelling, for a path parameter, or for the
  persistence itself.

  `validateParamKey` only ever checked a charset (`= & ? # % / \` and whitespace),
  so `"__proto__"` was accepted as a param name. It can never work: the router
  withholds that one key from `state.params` / `state.search` at the channel copy,
  so the value has no way to reach a URL. Measured before this change:

  ```
  persistentParamsPluginFactory(["__proto__", "mode"])   ACCEPTED
  navigate("page", {}, { __proto__: "V", mode: "dev" })
    href                              /page?mode=dev
    state.context.persistentParams    { __proto__: undefined, mode: "dev" }
  ```

  So the plugin published a key that was both unusable and `undefined`-valued,
  beside the params that do work. It now throws a `TypeError` at factory time, and
  the message says why rather than reporting the name as malformed — `"__proto__"`
  IS a non-empty string, so the generic "Expected array of non-empty strings"
  reads as a contradiction to whoever wrote it.

  ⚠ **The refusal is NARROW, and that is measured.** Across all twelve own members
  of `Object.prototype`, each tracked and navigated with a value, eleven print
  `/page?<name>=V` and land in `state.search` — including the four `__define*__` /
  `__lookup*__` accessors. Only `__proto__` never arrives. Refusing the others
  would retire a working capability.

  ⚠ A SOURCE LITERAL `{ __proto__: "x" }` is unaffected and always was: it sets the
  object's prototype and creates no own key, so there is no param by that name to
  refuse. The own-key spellings (`Object.fromEntries`, `JSON.parse`, a computed
  key) are the ones this reaches.

  **Documentation, and the other half of the issue.** `extractOwnParams` was named,
  documented and commented as the plugin's prototype-pollution boundary while its
  example built the wrong shape — `Object.create({ __proto__: … })` creates no own
  key, so it demonstrated inherited-key filtering and never the concern it named —
  and promised an output "(no `__proto__`)" that the function does not produce. Both
  docblocks now state what the helpers actually guarantee: own keys only, every own
  key kept as ordinary data whatever it is called, and the write safe against an
  ambient accessor since `putField`. Stripping the key there would be redundant
  rather than safer — an untracked name is filtered downstream (measured: it
  reaches neither the URL, nor `state.search`, nor the published context), and a
  tracked one can no longer be `"__proto__"`.

  Every record this plugin builds was written with `dst[key] = value`, which is
  `[[Set]]` and therefore consults the destination's prototype chain first. The
  keys are the plugin's own configured param names and the caller's bag — exactly
  the names an application routes under — so an accessor on `Object.prototype`
  under one of them hijacked the write. Measured, three shapes:

  - the factory itself threw at boot: `persistentParamsPluginFactory(["lang"])` →
    `TypeError: Cannot set property lang of #<Object> which has only a getter`;
  - `extractOwnParams`, the guard that exists to sanitise a bag, dropped the
    caller's key from the URL — the sanitiser as the leak;
  - with a getter+setter pair nothing threw at all: `buildPath("page")` printed
    `/page` instead of `/page?lang=fr`, and `state.context.persistentParams` went
    `undefined`.

  All six sites in the package — five writes plus the factory's `Object.assign`,
  which `copyFields` replaces — now go through the new `@real-router/core/utils`
  subpath. ⚠ One of the six, in `onTransitionSuccess`, is measured INERT: its target
  is a spread of the snapshot and already owns every tracked key, so the guard
  takes the same branch a plain store would. It is written that way for
  consistency, and the site says so. Verified against all
  three hazard shapes: identical to the control in every one.

### Patch Changes

- [#1677](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/1677) [`ba010a3`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/ba010a327e0fdbd901b91fe0132d029e38d1724e) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - A committed `UNKNOWN_ROUTE` state is no longer read as a param removal ([#1676](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1676))

  `onTransitionSuccess` treats a tracked key that is absent from the committed state as an irreversible removal ([#803](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/803)). Core's 404 state is hand-built with both channels empty — it matched no route, so there is no route to declare where its keys belong — which the plugin read as `navigate(…, { key: undefined })` and used to retire the key for the rest of the router's life.

  Every core channel that commits a 404 hit this: `start()` on an unmatched path (the plugin was dead before the app's first navigation), a popstate onto a dead link, and `replace()` dropping the active route. The last one broke the persistent-params e2e of all six `combined` examples ([#1674](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1674)).

  The snapshot now passes through such a commit untouched, and is still published to `state.context.persistentParams` so a 404 page reads it like any other route. Explicit removal via `navigate(…, { key: undefined })` and the defensive removal on a hand-built `navigateToState` are unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- [#1587](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/1587) [`cb6b507`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/cb6b507bcd93c6ba2736ae8ac0aa17090b247507) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Search-aware forwardState and buildPath interceptors ([#1548](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1548))

  Both interceptors now take the third `search` argument (RFC-4 M2). The
  `forwardState` interceptor forwards it down the chain, so a downstream
  `search-schema-plugin` interceptor still observes the matched query on the
  URL→State path. The `buildPath` interceptor is search-aware: when the caller
  supplies an explicit `search` channel, persistent (query) params are injected
  there — the channel the built URL takes its query from. ([#1563](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1563) completes the
  move: the single-bag call shape injects into `search` as well.)

- [#1587](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/1587) [`cb6b507`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/cb6b507bcd93c6ba2736ae8ac0aa17090b247507) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Inject persistent values into the search channel, not the params bag ([#1563](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1563))

  The plugin declares its keys as query params (`setRootPath("?a&b")`) but wrote
  their values into the path bag, leaving core to route them back. Both
  interceptors now write the query channel only, so the plugin is channel-correct
  by construction (RFC-4 M2 / [#1548](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1548)) and the path bag it is handed passes through
  untouched.

  - `forwardState` injects into `result.search`; a removal marker
    (`{ key: undefined }`) is now honored in **either** channel — previously
    `navigate(name, {}, { key: undefined })` left the key on the built URL.
  - `buildPath` injects into `search` on both call shapes. With no explicit
    `search` the caller's params bag is the query source core would read
    (`search ?? params`), so its content is routed through `search` — which also
    fixes a route declaring `defaultSearch` swallowing the injection entirely
    (`buildPath` disagreed with what `navigate` commits).
  - A caller value still wins over the stored one in either channel, and a tracked
    key passed in the path bag alone keeps the caller's value.
  - **Breaking edge:** a persistent key that also names a **path slot** on the
    target route (`/x/:lang` with a persisted `lang`) no longer fills that slot —
    the value belongs to the query channel, so `buildPath`/`navigate` now throw
    `Missing required param` unless the caller supplies it.

### Patch Changes

- [#1587](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/1587) [`cb6b507`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/cb6b507bcd93c6ba2736ae8ac0aa17090b247507) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Move the documented examples to the query channel ([#1572](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/1572))

  Core's channel guard now throws when a key a route declares with `?name`
  arrives in the `params` bag, so this package's README and guide examples — which
  showed the legacy single-bag form — no longer describe working code.

  Examples and tests moved to the explicit query argument:
  `navigate("products", {}, { lang: "en" })`. No runtime change in this package.

  An UNDECLARED tracked key is unaffected: the guard only fires on names the route
  declares with `?`.

  Type imports move `@real-router/types` → `@real-router/core`, and the `StateContext`
  module augmentation retargets `declare module "@real-router/types"` → `"@real-router/core/types"`
  (wave-2 fold). Internal repackaging — no public API or runtime-behaviour change.

  The `isPrimitiveValue` helper now lives in `src/is-primitive-value.ts` instead of the dissolved `type-guards` package. Internal refactor — no public API or validation-behaviour change.

  Removing a persistent param via `navigate(name, { key: undefined })` no longer drops the param permanently when the navigation is rejected by a guard or superseded by a concurrent navigate. The removal is now committed in `onTransitionSuccess`, against the state that actually committed, so a transition that never commits leaves the param intact.

  - `forwardState` records removals transiently instead of mutating the tracked set/snapshot before guards run; the paired `buildPath` consumes the record so the built URL still drops the removed param for the current transition.
  - Permanent removal (from both the snapshot and the tracked param set) happens in `onTransitionSuccess`, keyed on the committed state — a successful removal stays permanent (unchanged), while a rejected/cancelled one rolls back.

### Minor Changes

- [#443](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/443) [`7801bad`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/7801bad69d20728a0816f4d84c42cb8fbcf30a97) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `@real-router/internal-source` export condition for monorepo-internal src resolution ([#431](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/431))

  A new scoped export condition `@real-router/internal-source` is added to the package exports. Monorepo-internal TypeScript checking (via `tsconfig.json` `customConditions`) and Vitest (via the `workspaceSourceAliases` helper) now resolve `@real-router/*` imports to their `src/*.ts` files directly — no `dist/` artifacts required.

  External consumers (Vite, Webpack, Node.js) don't recognize this scoped condition name, so they continue to resolve via `import` / `require` → `dist/` exactly as before. The `@real-router/internal-source` entry is invisible to non-monorepo tools and doesn't change published package behavior.

  This structurally eliminates the race condition that caused flaky CI type-checks ([#431](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/431)) and makes the monorepo resilient to incomplete `.d.ts` generation from tsdown + rolldown RC ([#425](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/425)).

### Patch Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/28) [`bfd2e5a`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/bfd2e5a560fa7ab701d9f59b4ea09c3779830c83) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - fix: use @real-router/types for shared type definitions

  All packages now import types from @real-router/types instead of bundling
  their own copies. This fixes TypeScript type compatibility issues when
  using multiple @real-router packages together.

- Updated dependencies [[`bfd2e5a`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/bfd2e5a560fa7ab701d9f59b4ea09c3779830c83)]:

### Patch Changes

- [`1319fb1`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/1319fb11de379534f213da091b6c190a7b6be46b) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - fix: resolve workspace:^ dependencies to actual versions

  Previous release published packages with unresolved workspace:^ protocol
  in dependencies, causing npm install to fail. This release fixes the
  issue by using pnpm publish which correctly converts workspace references.

- Updated dependencies [[`1319fb1`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/1319fb11de379534f213da091b6c190a7b6be46b)]:
  - @real-router/core@0.2.3

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- fix: bundle internal dependencies, publish logger package
  - Make logger public as @real-router/logger
  - Bundle type-guards, route-tree, search-params into consuming packages
  - Use dts-bundle-generator for TypeScript declarations (inlines all types)
  - Update release workflow to publish logger first

  This fixes installation failures where npm couldn't resolve workspace-only packages.

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @real-router/core@0.2.2

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`5f59ef3`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/5f59ef3f72ad3f26346c0e3e821822cc4fde120c) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - fix: resolve workspace:^ dependencies correctly in published packages

  Previously, workspace:^ dependencies were published to npm as-is, causing
  installation failures. Now workspace protocols are replaced with actual
  version numbers before publishing.

- Updated dependencies [[`5f59ef3`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/5f59ef3f72ad3f26346c0e3e821822cc4fde120c)]:
