### Minor Changes

- [#695](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/695) [`51b993e`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/51b993e7877e2b12f4e6ca0b8078f7ab4629501f) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Fix scroll restoration not firing on browser back/forward under navigation-plugin ([#694](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/694))

  Since [#657](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/657) lifted `replace` into `TransitionMeta`, a history **traversal** (back/forward) under `navigation-plugin` now arrives with `transition.replace === true` — a traversal reuses an existing history entry, which is replace-shaped at the history level. `createScrollRestoration` evaluated its replace-skip guard _before_ the back/traverse restore branch, so every back/forward navigation was swallowed and the saved scroll position was never restored.

  Reordered the restore decision tree so `reload` and `back`/`traverse` restore branches run **before** the genuine in-place-replace skip (`router.navigate({ replace: true })`, `navigateToNotFound` still skip as before).

  Also hardened restore for a custom `scrollContainer` that mounts or lays out a few frames after the navigation settles (heavy routes): restore now re-applies the scroll across a bounded frame budget until the container exists and the position sticks, instead of a single best-effort `scrollTo` that could clamp to 0 against not-yet-laid-out content.

  New top-level `scrollSpy?: ScrollSpyOptions` prop wires `createScrollSpy(router, options)` from `shared/dom-utils/`. The URL hash tracks the topmost visible anchor as the user scrolls, syncing `state.context.url.hash` so sibling `<Link hash>` highlights re-evaluate via the standard `createActiveRouteSource` pipeline.

  ```tsx
  <RouterProvider router={router} scrollSpy={{ selector: "[id]:is(h2,h3)" }}>
    {/* Your app */}
  </RouterProvider>
  ```

  Emits a forced same-route transition with `{ hash, replace: true, force: true, hashChange: true }` — the same write API as `<Link hash>` ([#532](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/532)) with `replace: true` so the spy doesn't pollute history. Three anti-flicker gates (`isTransitioning`, `coolingDown` cleared on `scrollend` or 500 ms fallback, `selfEmitting` guard around own emit). Wired through `useEffect` with primitive deps so inline `scrollSpy={{ selector: "[id]" }}` doesn't thrash on parent re-renders.

  Requires `browser-plugin` or `navigation-plugin` for `state.context.url` claim. Under `hash-plugin` / `memory-plugin` / no URL plugin → warn-once + NOOP. SSR / browsers without `IntersectionObserver` = NOOP.

  See [Scroll Spy guide](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/wiki/Scroll-Spy) and the [`examples/web/react/hash-examples/scroll-spy/`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/tree/master/examples/web/react/hash-examples/scroll-spy) dogfood example (12 sections, TOC sidebar, plugin & spy-mode switchers, 10 e2e scenarios).

### Minor Changes

- [#658](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/658) [`5313156`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/531315635e0635f1fe98975e74d3bb0d1e14421f) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - **BREAKING CHANGE (behaviour):** scroll-restoration disambiguation under `browser-plugin` ([#658](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/658))

  `createScrollRestoration` (used by `<RouterProvider scrollRestoration>`) now disambiguates push, replace, and reload transitions under `@real-router/browser-plugin` using the portable `state.transition.replace` / `state.transition.reload` flags introduced in `@real-router/core`. Before this release the utility had no portable way to read `replace` under browser-plugin, so it called `scrollToHashOrTop` on **every** transition. After this release:
  - Programmatic replace (`navigate(..., { replace: true })`, OAuth callbacks, params canonicalization, `navigateToNotFound()`, auto-force-from-`UNKNOWN_ROUTE`) → **skip** (scroll position preserved)
  - Programmatic reload (`navigate(..., { reload: true })`) → **restore** from `sessionStorage`
  - Forward push (`<Link>` without `replace`), browser back/forward (popstate), F5 cross-document → `scrollToHashOrTop` (unchanged)

  Under `@real-router/navigation-plugin` there is no behaviour change — every existing branch (`replace` / `reload` / `traverse` / `direction === "back"`) remains active.

  Opt-out for the legacy snap-on-every-transition behaviour: `scrollRestoration={{ mode: "top" }}`.

  This release also bundles the updated `transition.replace` core field; existing code reading `state.context.navigation.navigationType` is unaffected.

  Two paired components for opt-in client/server rendering boundaries that
  formalize the `useState`/`useEffect` "isMounted" idiom every SSR app
  re-implements:
  - `<ClientOnly fallback={…}>{children}</ClientOnly>` — server emits
    `fallback` (or nothing), client matches it on first paint, then a single
    post-mount effect swaps in `children`. Use for browser-API consumers
    (window/document/intersection observers), ad slots, or third-party widgets
    that hydrate to the right shape without a hydration mismatch.
  - `<ServerOnly fallback={…}>{children}</ServerOnly>` — server emits
    `children`, client matches them on first paint, then swaps to `fallback`
    (or hides). Use for SEO-only meta strips, zero-JS sections inside an
    otherwise-hydrated page.

  Both components are exported from `@real-router/react`, `@real-router/react/legacy`,
  and re-exported as types under the `react-server` condition.

  ```tsx
  import { ClientOnly, ServerOnly } from "@real-router/react";

  <ClientOnly fallback={<Skeleton />}>
    <BrowserApiWidget />
  </ClientOnly>

  <ServerOnly>
    <SeoHelpStrip />
  </ServerOnly>
  ```

  Render-time HTTP status declaration for SSR. Mount inside a route component (typical use case: a glob `*` route's NotFound page) when the status is decided by the rendered tree rather than a loader. Server reads `sink.code` after `renderToString` / `renderToReadableStream` and applies it to the HTTP response.

  Exports from `@real-router/react/ssr` (and `@real-router/react/legacy/ssr`):
  - `<HttpStatusCode code={404}/>` — writes `code` to the nearest sink during render, returns `null`. Last write wins.
  - `<HttpStatusProvider sink={...}>` — provides the sink via context.
  - `createHttpStatusSink(): HttpStatusSink` — factory; sink is `{ code: number | undefined }`.
  - Type-only exports under the `react-server` condition.

  ```tsx
  // entry-server.tsx
  import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";
  import {
    createHttpStatusSink,
    HttpStatusProvider,
  } from "@real-router/react/ssr";

  const sink = createHttpStatusSink();
  const html = renderToString(
    <HttpStatusProvider sink={sink}>
      <RouterProvider router={router}>
        <App />
      </RouterProvider>
    </HttpStatusProvider>,
  );
  response.status(sink.code ?? 200).send(html);
  ```

  No-op on the client when no provider is mounted — the same component tree hydrates without touching the DOM. Loader-driven errors (`LoaderNotFound` → 404, `LoaderRedirect` → 30x) keep working as before; this component covers render-time decisions only.

- [#643](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/643) [`f243451`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/f24345194efac6bd85cefed0d4de340c6cc9086c) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - `useDeferred()` hook + `<Await>` and `<Streamed>` components for consuming `defer()` payloads ([#610](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/610))

  Three new exports paired with `defer()` in `@real-router/ssr-data-plugin`:
  - `useDeferred<T>(key)` — reads the promise published by the loader at
    `state.context.ssrDataDeferred[key]`. Stable promise reference across
    renders within one navigation; integrates with React 19's `use(promise)`
    for native Suspense streaming. Returns a never-resolving promise (forever
    fallback) when the key is missing — surfaces consumer/loader key drift
    as a visible loading state.
  - `<Await name="key">{(value) => …}</Await>` — ergonomic wrapper around
    `useDeferred(name)` + `use(promise)`, mirrors the SvelteKit `{#await}` /
    Solid `<Await/>` pair for cross-framework naming consistency. Main entry
    only — `use()` requires React 19.
  - `<Streamed fallback={…}>{children}</Streamed>` — alias for
    `<Suspense fallback>` matching the cross-adapter "Streamed" naming.
    Available in both main and `/legacy` entries (legacy only ships
    `<Streamed>` + `useDeferred`, not `<Await>`).

  `useDeferred` and `<Streamed>` ship in both the main entry and `/legacy`
  (React 18+) entries. `<Await>` ships in the main entry only. The
  `react-server` condition entry exposes the prop / option types only
  (no client runtime).

  ```tsx
  import { Streamed, Await, useDeferred } from "@real-router/react";

  // High-level — cross-adapter naming
  <Streamed fallback={<Spinner />}>
    <Await<Review[]> name="reviews">
      {(reviews) => <ReviewList items={reviews} />}
    </Await>
  </Streamed>

  // Low-level — React-native primitives
  <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
    <Reviews />
  </Suspense>

  function Reviews() {
    const reviews = use(useDeferred<Review[]>("reviews"));
    return <ReviewList items={reviews} />;
  }
  ```

  Pairs with `injectDeferredScripts` from `@real-router/ssr-data-plugin/server`
  for the server-side wire format. Non-breaking addition — existing
  `<Suspense>` + `use(promise)` patterns continue to work unchanged.

  Adds a thin type-only re-export entry resolved under the `react-server` export condition. RSC bundlers (`@vitejs/plugin-rsc`, `react-server-dom-{webpack,turbopack,parcel}`) now resolve `@real-router/react` imports to a server-safe subset when bundling Server Component code, preventing accidental inclusion of client-only hooks/components/`RouterProvider` in server bundles.

  The exposed surface is intentionally type-only — all hooks, components, and `RouterProvider` remain client-exclusive. Future server-safe utilities (pure functions without React state) can be added without breaking the contract.

  Per-request RSC data loading is handled by [`@real-router/rsc-server-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@real-router/rsc-server-plugin), not this entry. Mirrors the thin re-export pattern from [TanStack Router PR #7183](https://github.com/TanStack/router/pull/7183) and `react-router@7.x`.

  ```tsx
  // In a Server Component file (resolved under `react-server` condition):
  import type { Navigator, LinkProps } from "@real-router/react";
  // → resolves to server-safe types only, no runtime client code
  ```

  Additive change, no breaking. See [RSC Integration wiki guide](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/wiki/RSC-Integration).

  All SSR-aware components and hooks have moved out of the main entry into a
  dedicated `/ssr` subpath:

  | Was                                                | Now                                                    |
  | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `import { ClientOnly } from "@real-router/react"`  | `import { ClientOnly } from "@real-router/react/ssr"`  |
  | `import { ServerOnly } from "@real-router/react"`  | `import { ServerOnly } from "@real-router/react/ssr"`  |
  | `import { Await } from "@real-router/react"`       | `import { Await } from "@real-router/react/ssr"`       |
  | `import { Streamed } from "@real-router/react"`    | `import { Streamed } from "@real-router/react/ssr"`    |
  | `import { useDeferred } from "@real-router/react"` | `import { useDeferred } from "@real-router/react/ssr"` |

  For React 18 (`/legacy`) consumers, the corresponding subset lives at
  `@real-router/react/legacy/ssr` (omits `<Await>` since it depends on React
  19's `use(promise)`).

  **Why split now**: the `<ClientOnly>`/`<ServerOnly>` pair ([#604](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/604)) plus the
  `defer()` consumer trio (`<Await>`, `<Streamed>`, `useDeferred`) reaches the
  ≥3 SSR-feature-component threshold defined in `.claude/SSR_FEATURE_GAPS_RU.md`
  §8. Splitting in this PR avoids a future double migration when the same
  work lands across the remaining 5 adapters ([#611](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/611), Stage 2).

  **Why this matters**:
  - **Type isolation** — server-only prop types (`AwaitProps`, `StreamedProps`,
    etc.) no longer leak into the client TypeScript context for app code that
    doesn't touch SSR.
  - **DX clarity** — `import {…} from '@real-router/react/ssr'` self-documents
    the SSR-pipeline intent.
  - **`react-server` condition** — the `/ssr` subpath has its own type-only
    RSC entry, so Server Components can import the prop types without pulling
    client-only runtime into their bundle.
  - **Future-proofing** — server-render utilities (`<HttpStatusCode>`, etc.)
    slot into `/ssr` without re-shaping the main entry.

  **Breaking change** (pre-1.0, allowed in `minor` per `.changeset/README.md`):
  re-import the five exports from `/ssr` (or `/legacy/ssr` for React 18).
  Bundle cost is ≈ 0 thanks to `"sideEffects": false` + tree-shaking — the
  split is about API surface design, not bytes.

### Patch Changes

- [#643](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/643) [`f243451`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/f24345194efac6bd85cefed0d4de340c6cc9086c) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Guard against throwing `getAnnouncementText` in `createRouteAnnouncer` ([#628](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/628))

  A user-provided `getAnnouncementText` callback that throws was propagating
  the exception up through `router.subscribe`'s listener loop, tearing down
  sibling listeners and breaking navigation tracking elsewhere. The shared
  `resolveText` helper now wraps the callback in try/catch, logs the error
  via `console.error` with a `[real-router]` prefix, and falls through to
  the built-in resolution chain (`<h1>` textContent → `document.title` →
  route name → pathname).

  User-visible effect: a buggy custom announcer resolver no longer breaks
  router subscriptions — the announcer announces the fallback text and
  logs the underlying error so the bug surfaces in dev tools.

  Discovered during the React audit (`review-2026-05-10` §5.7, MED
  severity). Applied to `shared/dom-utils/route-announcer.ts` and the
  git-tracked Angular copy.

  `shallowEqual({ a: undefined }, { b: "" })` returned `true` while
  `shallowEqual({ b: "" }, { a: undefined })` returned `false`. The inner loop
  read missing keys via bracket access as `undefined` and falsely matched
  `prev[key] === undefined`. Added a `hasOwnProperty` guard mirroring React's
  own `shallowEqual` (`packages/shared/shallowEqual.js`).

  Discovered by a new property-based symmetry test in
  `tests/property/shallowEqual.properties.ts` after fast-check shrunk the
  counterexample to `[{"a":undefined},{"b":""}]` over 200 runs.

  User-visible effect: `<Link routeParams={{ a: undefined }} />` no longer
  compares equal to `<Link routeParams={{ b: undefined }} />` — re-render now
  matches the documented `shallowEqual` contract (key-order-insensitive,
  `Object.is` per key).

  `createScrollRestoration` (`shared/dom-utils/`) gains three changes:
  - **Mode rename `manual` → `native`** for clarity. The previous name was misleading because it had the OPPOSITE meaning of DOM `history.scrollRestoration === "manual"`: utility's mode meant "utility does nothing, browser handles natively", while DOM `"manual"` means "browser does nothing, app handles". Renamed to `"native"` to match the actual semantic ("hand off to browser-native restore").
  - **`behavior?: ScrollBehavior`** — forwarded to `scrollTo({ behavior })` and `scrollIntoView({ behavior })`. Values: `"auto"` (default), `"instant"`, `"smooth"`. See [MDN ScrollToOptions.behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScrollToOptions/behavior).
  - **`storageKey?: string`** — sessionStorage key for scroll-store, default `"real-router:scroll"`. Override for namespace-isolation between independent `RouterProvider` instances (micro-frontends, embedded widgets, testing setups).

  `RouterProvider` now forwards all three options. Default behavior unchanged.

  - `<Link>` accepts an optional `hash?: string` prop that builds a URL with
    the fragment via the URL plugin's `router.buildUrl(name, params, { hash })`
    extension and, on click, calls the new `navigateWithHash` helper. The
    helper auto-bypasses SAME_STATES (`force: true, hashChange: true`) when
    the same route is navigated to with a different fragment, so anchor-style
    same-path links update both URL and `state.context.url.hashChanged`.
  - `useIsActiveRoute(name, params, strict?, ignoreQueryParams?, hash?)` gains
    an optional fifth `hash` argument. When provided, the hook is `true` iff
    the route matches AND `state.context.url.hash` equals the requested
    fragment exactly — distinct hashes get distinct cache entries in
    `@real-router/sources` (see its changeset).

  `createScrollRestoration` now reads the anchor target from
  `state.context.url.hash` (decoded, populated by the URL plugins) rather than
  `globalThis.location.hash`, falling back to the DOM only when no URL plugin
  is installed. This avoids race conditions between React's commit and the
  browser's hash update.

  `useRoute()` previously returned `{ route: State | undefined }`, forcing every consumer to write `route?.x` or `if (!route) return null` — defensive code for a case that is unreachable once `await router.start()` has resolved. The hook now throws `"useRoute called with no active route. Did you forget to await router.start() before rendering, or is the router stopped/disposed?"` when invoked before start (or after stop/dispose), and the return type narrows so consumers can read `route.params.id` directly. `useRouteNode(name)` is unchanged — `route === undefined` there is a legitimate "node inactive" business state.

### Minor Changes

- [#552](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/552) [`1e9868e`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/1e9868ef02ed8f34f809fbd8bccd2a855d9a1fe2) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `useRouteEnter` hook ([#548](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/548))

  Symmetric counterpart to `useRouteExit` ([#544](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/544)). Fires `handler` once when the component mounts as a result of a navigation, with the mount-time `{ route, previousRoute }` snapshot.

  ```tsx
  import { useRouteEnter } from "@real-router/react";

  useRouteEnter(({ route, previousRoute }) => {
    analytics.track("page_enter", {
      route: route.name,
      from: previousRoute.name,
    });
  });
  ```

  What the hook covers that ad-hoc `useEffect` + `useRoute()` doesn't:
  - **Skip-initial** — handler is skipped when there is no `previousRoute` (i.e. first-load mount). Most consumers want to fire side effects only on real navigations, not on hydration.
  - **StrictMode double-mount immunity** — in dev, React's StrictMode runs every effect twice to surface bugs. Without a guard, analytics fire twice, animations restart, focus jumps. The hook tracks the last-handled `route` reference and short-circuits the second pass.
  - **Latest-handler ref** — handler can change identity on every render without re-running the effect.
  - **Mount-time snapshot** — handler receives the values that were live at the moment of mount, not the latest ones.

  Common scenarios covered: direction-aware entry animation (read `route.context.browser?.direction`), source-aware focus management (`route.context.browser?.source === "navigate"`), analytics page-enter events, request cancellation tied to navigation.

  Race-safety: `useRoute()` is wired through `useSyncExternalStore` from `@real-router/sources`, so by the time the new component's effect runs, the snapshot is the post-commit one. The hook does not need a separate centralised buffer or new context — it consumes `useRoute()` directly.

  Replication to Preact / Vue / Solid / Svelte / Angular tracked in [#547](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/547).

- [#552](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/552) [`1e9868e`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/1e9868ef02ed8f34f809fbd8bccd2a855d9a1fe2) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `useRouteExit` hook ([#544](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/544))

  New React-side primitive for animation and side-effect coordination during the leave window.

  **`useRouteExit(handler, options?)`** — wraps `router.subscribeLeave` with the universal guards: reentrant abort pre-check, same-route skip (`route.name === nextRoute.name`, opt-out via `skipSameRoute: false`), latest-handler ref so handler identity can change without resubscribing.

  ```tsx
  import { useRouteExit } from "@real-router/react";

  useRouteExit(async ({ signal }) => {
    await api.saveDraft(formState, { signal });
  });
  ```

  The hook is general-purpose — animation is one case. Other scenarios: auto-save form drafts, cancel inflight requests, capture scroll position, optimistic-UI rollback, library-coordinated exit (motion's `AnimatePresence onExitComplete`).

  Companion utility shipped alongside in `shared/dom-utils`:
  - **`createDirectionTracker(router)`** — popstate-driven `data-nav-direction` on `<html>` for direction-aware CSS / library state. Must be installed **before** `router.usePlugin(browserPluginFactory())` due to popstate listener ordering. Used in `examples/web/react/animation-examples/route-animations`.

  **Breaking (pre-1.0):** `createRouteAnimator` and the internal `awaitElementAnimations` helper are removed from `shared/dom-utils`. The single consumer (`route-animations` example) was rewritten as a presence-only React component (`<PageAnimator />`) built on top of `useRouteExit`, symmetric with `<HeroMorph />` and `<ListFlip />` already in that example. The 4-line CSS-class exit recipe (style flush + `Element.getAnimations()` + `Promise.allSettled`) is inlined where it runs — pedagogically clearer than a separate utility, no abstraction tax.

  Migration if you used `createRouteAnimator(router, { exitClass, selector })` directly: write a small React component that calls `useRouteExit` with the same recipe. See `examples/web/react/animation-examples/route-animations/src/animations/PageAnimator.tsx` for the canonical 30-line implementation.

  Replication to Preact / Vue / Solid / Svelte / Angular tracked in [#547](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/547).

- [#552](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/552) [`1e9868e`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/1e9868ef02ed8f34f809fbd8bccd2a855d9a1fe2) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `viewTransitions` prop on `<RouterProvider>` for View Transitions API integration ([#498](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/498))

  Opt in with `<RouterProvider router={router} viewTransitions>` to animate route transitions via the browser's View Transitions API. The prop is a boolean — utility is either enabled or no-op (SSR, Firefox without VT support).

  Customization is pure CSS via `::view-transition-*` pseudo-elements and `view-transition-name`. See the [View Transitions wiki page](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/wiki/View-Transitions) for patterns (hero morph, per-area transitions, direction-aware animations).

  The utility lives in `shared/dom-utils/` as `createViewTransitions(router)` — same architectural pattern as `createScrollRestoration` ([#497](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/497)) and `createRouteAnnouncer`. It uses only the public `subscribeLeave` + `subscribe` router API.

  `RouteView.Self` renders its children when the active route name equals the
  parent `RouteView`'s `nodeName` and no descendant `Match` is active. This
  closes the API gap that previously forced imperative
  `route.name === ...` ternaries when a parent route IS the listing of its
  children.

  ```tsx
  <RouteView nodeName="users">
    <RouteView.Self>
      <UsersList />
    </RouteView.Self>
    <RouteView.Match segment="profile">
      <UserProfile />
    </RouteView.Match>
    <RouteView.Match segment="settings">
      <UserSettings />
    </RouteView.Match>
  </RouteView>
  ```

  Priority order: `Match` (descendant of `nodeName`) → `Self` (active equals
  `nodeName`) → `NotFound` (`UNKNOWN_ROUTE`). At most one slot renders. Multiple
  `Self` instances follow the first-wins rule (mirrors `NotFound`). `Self`
  accepts an optional `fallback` prop that wraps children in `<Suspense>`.

### Minor Changes

- [#502](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/502) [`dcfd9cc`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/dcfd9cc2578c22449d2653d25d0b09a0fdb74681) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add opt-in scroll restoration via `RouterProvider.scrollRestoration` ([#497](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/497))

  New `scrollRestoration?: ScrollRestorationOptions` prop on `RouterProvider`. Restores scroll position on back navigation, scrolls to top or hash on push. Supports `manual` / `top` / `restore` modes and a custom scroll container.

  ```tsx
  <RouterProvider router={router} scrollRestoration={{ mode: "restore" }}>
    {/* ... */}
  </RouterProvider>
  ```

  Backed by the shared `createScrollRestoration` utility in `shared/dom-utils` — same pattern as `createRouteAnnouncer`. Direction is read from `@real-router/navigation-plugin`'s `state.context.navigation`; position is persisted across reloads via `sessionStorage` + `pagehide`.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- [#494](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/494) [`b0cdc41`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/b0cdc410ee97b3b8b7012216f863756be832d729) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `@real-router/react/ink` subpath export for Ink (terminal UI) ([#493](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/493))

  New third entry alongside `main` and `/legacy`, targeting React 19.2+ & Ink 7+. Ships all shared hooks plus two terminal-specific pieces:
  - **`InkRouterProvider`** — wrapper around the shared `RouterProvider` that omits `announceNavigation` (no DOM, no aria-live).
  - **`InkLink`** — focusable text link built on Ink's `useFocus` + `useInput`. Joins the focus ring (Tab to move, Enter to navigate). Props mirror `Link`: `routeName`, `routeParams`, `routeOptions`, `activeStrict`, `ignoreQueryParams`. DOM-only props (`className`, `target`, `onClick`) are replaced with terminal equivalents (`activeColor`, `focusColor`, `inverse`/`activeInverse`/`focusInverse`, `onSelect`).

  ```tsx
  import {
    InkLink,
    InkRouterProvider,
    useRouteNode,
  } from "@real-router/react/ink";

  <InkRouterProvider router={router}>
    <InkLink routeName="home" focusColor="cyan" activeColor="green" autoFocus>
      Home
    </InkLink>
  </InkRouterProvider>;
  ```

  `ink` is added as an **optional** peer dependency (`peerDependenciesMeta.ink.optional = true`) — existing DOM consumers don't need to install it. The main and `/legacy` entries are unchanged.

  `useRoute<P>()` now accepts an optional generic so `route.params` is typed without `as` casts at the call site. The generic is erased at compile time — no runtime change. `RouteContext<P>` is likewise generic, defaulting to `Params`.

  ```typescript
  type SearchParams = { q: string; sort: string } & Params;

  const { route } = useRoute<SearchParams>();

  route?.params.q; // typed as string — no cast needed
  route?.params.sort; // typed as string
  ```

  Migrated internal hooks to `getTransitionSource` / `getErrorSource` from `@real-router/sources` — multiple consumers now share one router subscription per router instance instead of creating fresh WeakMap caches locally. Removed duplicated `useStableValue` helper (params stabilization is now canonical inside `createActiveRouteSource`).

- [#474](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/474) [`d6c1b39`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/d6c1b39e7c2b6c427be062b13ba3eb633eadc7c3) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - refactor: remove redundant `routeUtilsCache` WeakMap in `useRouteUtils` ([#467](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/467))

  `getRouteUtils` from `@real-router/route-utils` is already WeakMap-cached
  per `RouteTreeNode`, so the extra per-router cache in the React adapter
  was redundant — the same `RouteUtils` instance is returned across renders
  by the internal cache. Aligns React with the 5 other adapters (Preact,
  Solid, Vue, Svelte, Angular) that rely on the shared cache directly.

- Updated dependencies [[`d6c1b39`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/d6c1b39e7c2b6c427be062b13ba3eb633eadc7c3), [`d6c1b39`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/d6c1b39e7c2b6c427be062b13ba3eb633eadc7c3), [`d6c1b39`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/d6c1b39e7c2b6c427be062b13ba3eb633eadc7c3)]:

  `Link`'s `areLinkPropsEqual` previously called `stableSerialize` (JSON.stringify with sorted keys) on `routeParams` and `routeOptions` twice per comparator invocation — ~850 ns per Link per parent re-render. Replaced with `shallowEqual` (Object.is per key, order-insensitive) — ~40 ns, a ~20× speed-up on the comparator hot path.
  - `shallowEqual` exported from `@real-router/react` dom-utils barrel (via `shared/dom-utils/link-utils.ts`)
  - Correctness improvements alongside the speed-up:
    - `{id: 1n}` vs `{id: 1n}` now correctly treated as equal (`Object.is` handles BigInt)
    - `{a: undefined}` vs `{}` now correctly treated as NOT equal (previous JSON-based path treated them as equal, masking structural differences)
    - Circular references and Symbol keys no longer trigger fallback paths
  - Trade-off: nested objects/arrays in `routeParams` with equal content but different references now trigger a re-render. Stabilize via `useMemo` if needed — standard React pattern. In practice `routeParams` is almost always a flat `Record<string, primitive>`.

  No public API change; gotcha documentation in `CLAUDE.md` updated.

  - **Hot path:** cache `createTransitionSource` per router via `WeakMap` — `useRouterTransition` no longer recreates the source on every render/router-ref change
  - **Hot path:** cache `RouteUtils` per router via `WeakMap` in `useRouteUtils` — drops repeated `getPluginApi().getTree()` lookups on re-render
  - **Hot path:** `RouterProvider` / `useRouteNode` now keep the raw `useSyncExternalStore` snapshot as the memo dependency instead of destructuring `{ route, previousRoute }`. `stabilizeState` guarantees the snapshot identity is preserved across idempotent navigations — consumers no longer re-render when the route did not change
  - **Hot path:** `useRouteNode` drops the redundant `useMemo` wrapper around `getNavigator(router)` — `getNavigator` is already WeakMap-cached in core
  - **`<RouteView>`:** memoize the flattened `Match`/`NotFound` element list on `children` identity. Steady-state navigations skip the `Children.toArray` + `collectElements` traversal; only re-traverse when the parent re-renders with a new `children` node. `ref` is lazy-initialized to avoid per-render `new Set()` allocation
  - **`<RouteView>`:** `isSegmentMatch` now early-returns `false` for empty-string `fullSegmentName` — prevents a literal route named `""` from matching against `activeStrict=false` prefix logic
  - **`useStableValue`:** rewritten as a pure `useRef` pattern with order-insensitive recursive JSON serialization via `stableSerialize`. Gracefully falls back to identity (`Object.is`) comparison when serialization throws (BigInt, circular refs, Symbol, function). Previously threw on BigInt and treated key-order permutations as different values
  - **Stress coverage:** new suites for dynamic routes, error boundary teardown, Suspense + transition, link-mass-rendering, mount/unmount lifecycle, transition-hook stress
  - **Performance tests:** new coverage for `useIsActiveRoute`, `useNavigator`, `useRouteUtils`, `useRouter` to lock in the WeakMap/cache invariants
  - **Property tests:** shared `linkUtils.properties.ts` now exercises the real `dom-utils` exports (`shouldNavigate`, `buildActiveClassName`, etc.) instead of inline replicas
  - **Docs:** README / ARCHITECTURE / CLAUDE brought back in sync with source — gotcha table updated to reflect the new stable-snapshot behavior

  No public API change.

  A new scoped export condition `@real-router/internal-source` is added to the package exports. Monorepo-internal TypeScript checking (via `tsconfig.json` `customConditions`) and Vitest (via the `workspaceSourceAliases` helper) now resolve `@real-router/*` imports to their `src/*.ts` files directly — no `dist/` artifacts required.

  External consumers (Vite, Webpack, Node.js) don't recognize this scoped condition name, so they continue to resolve via `import` / `require` → `dist/` exactly as before. The `@real-router/internal-source` entry is invisible to non-monorepo tools and doesn't change published package behavior.

  This structurally eliminates the race condition that caused flaky CI type-checks ([#431](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/431)) and makes the monorepo resilient to incomplete `.d.ts` generation from tsdown + rolldown RC ([#425](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/425)).

  WCAG-compliant screen reader announcements on route change. When enabled, a visually hidden `aria-live="assertive"` region announces each navigation, and focus moves to the first `<h1>` on the new page.

  ```tsx
  <RouterProvider router={router} announceNavigation>
  ```

  `useRouter`, `useRoute`, and `useNavigator` used React 19's `use()` API, breaking the `@real-router/react/legacy` entry point on React 18. Replaced with `useContext()` which is available in both React 18 and 19.

  **Breaking Change:** `RouterContext`, `RouteContext`, and `NavigatorContext` are no longer exported from `@real-router/react` or `@real-router/react/legacy`. Use the corresponding hooks instead.

  **Migration:**

  ```diff
  - import { RouterContext } from "@real-router/react";
  - const router = useContext(RouterContext);
  + import { useRouter } from "@real-router/react";
  + const router = useRouter();
  ```

  ```diff
  - import { RouteContext } from "@real-router/react";
  - const routeState = useContext(RouteContext);
  + import { useRoute } from "@real-router/react";

  **Breaking Change:** `useIsActiveRoute` is no longer exported from `@real-router/react` or `@real-router/react/legacy`. The hook remains as an internal utility used by `<Link>`.

  **Migration:**

  ```diff
  - import { useIsActiveRoute } from "@real-router/react";
  - const isActive = useIsActiveRoute("users.profile", { id });

  + import { useRouteNode } from "@real-router/react";
  + const { route } = useRouteNode("users");
  + const isActive = route?.name === "users.profile";
  ```

  Or use `<Link>` which handles active state automatically via render props.

  New `keepAlive` prop on `<RouteView.Match>` uses React 19.2 `<Activity>` API to hide deactivated matches instead of unmounting them, preserving DOM and React state:

  ```tsx
  <RouteView nodeName="">
    <RouteView.Match segment="users" keepAlive>
      <UsersPage />
    </RouteView.Match>
  </RouteView>

  **BREAKING CHANGE:** `<RouteView>` is no longer available via `@real-router/react/legacy`.

  **Migration:** Use `useRouteNode` + conditional rendering in React 18:

  ```tsx
  const { route } = useRouteNode("");
  if (startsWithSegment(route.name, "users")) return <UsersPage />;
  ```

  Or upgrade to React 19.2+ and import from `@real-router/react`.

  New hook for tracking router transition state. Returns `RouterTransitionSnapshot`
  with `isTransitioning`, `toRoute`, and `fromRoute`. Useful for progress bars,
  loading overlays, and disabling navigation during async guards.

  Available in both entry points (`@real-router/react` and `@real-router/react/legacy`).

  - `Link` now subscribes to active state via `useIsActiveRoute` — re-renders only when its own active status changes
  - `BaseLink` removed — `Link` takes router from context automatically
  - `ConnectedLink` removed — `Link` provides the same granular reactivity with less overhead
  - `BaseLinkProps` type replaced by `LinkProps<P>`
  - Removed: `data-route` and `data-active` HTML attributes
  - Fix: `routeOptions` (reload, replace) now correctly passed to navigation (previously silently dropped by `Link` and `ConnectedLink`)

  **BREAKING:** Main entry point (`@real-router/react`) now targets React 19.2+. React 18 users must switch to the legacy entry.

  **Migration:**

  ```diff
  - import { RouterProvider, useRouteNode, Link } from '@real-router/react';
  + import { RouterProvider, useRouteNode, Link } from '@real-router/react/legacy';
  ```

  Both entry points share the same code and export the same API. The `/legacy` entry excludes future React 19.2-only components (e.g., `ActivityRouteNode`).

  **New:**
  - `useNavigator()` hook for direct Navigator access
  - `NavigatorContext` for providing Navigator to components

  **BREAKING CHANGE:**
  - `useRoute()` now returns `{ navigator, route, previousRoute }` instead of `{ router, ... }`
  - `useRouteNode()` now returns `{ navigator, route, previousRoute }` instead of `{ router, ... }`

  **Migration:**

  ```tsx
  // Before
  const { router, route } = useRoute();
  router.navigate("home");

  // After
  const { navigator, route } = useRoute();
  navigator.navigate("home");

  // For full Router access:
