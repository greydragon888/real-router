# @real-router/navigation-plugin

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#487](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/487) [`8e4551f`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/8e4551f36af69732c0889f92a08e593a723b76c6) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - **BREAKING:** navigate event on unmatched URL in strict mode no longer silently redirects to `defaultRoute` ([#483](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/483))

  When `allowNotFound: false` and a navigate event targets a URL that matches no registered route, the plugin used to silently call `router.navigateToDefault()` inside `event.intercept`. This hid the error from logs, analytics, and the `onTransitionError` plugin hook.

  **New behaviour:**
  - `$$error` event is emitted with `ROUTE_NOT_FOUND` — reaches `Plugin.onTransitionError` hooks and `router.addEventListener("$$error", ...)` listeners.
  - `event.intercept()` handler rejects, so the Navigation API automatically rolls back the URL (no manual `browser.navigate()` call needed).
  - Router state is unchanged.

  The `defaultRoute` option now has a single purpose: it is only consulted by an **explicit** `router.navigateToDefault()` call.

  **Migration** — if you relied on the silent fallback:

  ```ts
  router.usePlugin(() => ({
    onTransitionError(_toState, _fromState, err) {
      if (err.code === "ROUTE_NOT_FOUND") {
        void router.navigateToDefault({ replace: true });
      }
    },
  }));
  ```

- [#472](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/472) [`a550f40`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/a550f4011ce499a1a56706a89e588652747cd944) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Fix URL helpers and harden options validation ([#470](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/470))

  **URL helpers (from shared `browser-env`)**
  - `normalizeBase` now collapses any run of slashes to a single `/` (previously `"/app//"` → `"/app/"`, `"//"` → `"/"`). Result is canonical: empty or starts with `/`, no trailing `/`, no `//` anywhere.
  - `extractPath` now guarantees a leading slash in the no-match branch.
  - `buildUrl` inserts the `/` separator when the path doesn't already start with one.
  - New `extractPathFromAbsoluteUrl(url, base, context)` helper — alias of `urlToPath` with explicit defensive semantics. Used in `entryToState` and the entry URL path to swallow malformed Navigation API URLs as `null` instead of throwing.

  **Plugin behavior**
  - Entry URL parsing (`entryToState`, `#buildEntryUrl`) now uses the defensive `extractPathFromAbsoluteUrl`. Malformed entry URLs (e.g., from mocks, extensions, or non-spec sources) no longer throw from the Navigation API event handler — they resolve to `undefined` / trigger the "no matching route" branch.
  - `browser.navigate(url, options)` now forwards the full `options` object to `nav.navigate` instead of picking only `state` and `history`. Lets callers pass `info`, `downloadRequest`, and any future Navigation API options transparently.
  - `replaceHistoryState` now preserves `location.hash` — symmetric with `onTransitionSuccess`.
  - `base` option is now validated against control characters and `..` segments (via the shared `safeBaseRule`).
  - Dropped the unused third `title?: string` parameter from `replaceHistoryState` type augmentation.
  - `shouldReplaceHistory` behavior for `{ replace: false, fromState: undefined }` is now confirmed as `false` (explicit user override). The invariant G4 description was rewritten — it no longer claims the function throws.

  **Internal / performance**
  - `onTransitionSuccess` now composes the URL via `buildUrl(toState.path, base)` instead of `router.buildUrl` dispatch — saves one method lookup per navigation. Tests spying on `router.buildUrl` inside `onTransitionSuccess` must spy on the browser-env `buildUrl` instead.
  - The hash-preservation branch skips the `url + ""` concatenation when the hash is empty.
  - Extracted `withRecovery(run)` helper in `navigate-handler.ts` — dedupes the two `try { await ... } catch { recoverFromNavigateError }` blocks.

  **Breaking (pre-1.0):**
  - `replaceHistoryState(name, params, title)` no longer type-checks — drop the third argument.
  - `base: "../evil"` and `base: "/app\nX"` now throw at factory time instead of silently passing through.

  `computeDirection("traverse", i, i)` now correctly returns `"unknown"` instead of `"back"` when destination and current indices are equal.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [#454](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/454) [`c835bfa`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/c835bfaec7d4fd6ca64525757e6cfc8092c11969) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Fix `extractPath` matching non-segment-boundary base prefix ([#446](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/446))

  `extractPath("/application/users", "/app")` incorrectly stripped the base, returning `/lication/users`. Now enforces `/`-delimited segment boundaries: only exact match (`pathname === base`) or segment-boundary match (`pathname.startsWith(base + "/")`) triggers stripping.

- [#453](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/453) [`27e788a`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/27e788a4b240657205a6abea473b310bfc2287fe) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Fix entryToState discarding query string and remove redundant shouldReplaceHistory call ([#449](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/449), [#450](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/450))

  **Bug fix ([#449](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/449)):** `entryToState` now includes `url.search` when matching history entries, aligning with `traverseToLast` and `handleNavigateEvent` which already preserved query strings. Previously, history extensions like `peekBack`, `hasVisited`, `canGoBackTo`, and `getVisitedRoutes` would fail to match entries whose URLs contained query parameters.

  **Performance ([#450](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/450)):** `onTransitionSuccess` no longer calls `shouldReplaceHistory()` a second time — the push/replace decision is derived from the already-computed `navigationType` on `capturedMeta`.

- [#452](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/452) [`d337422`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/d337422785674a5a0801d44cc1b99647562f0080) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Fix TypeError in `shouldReplaceHistory` when `replace:false` + `fromState:undefined` ([#447](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/447))

  Added optional chaining (`fromState?.path`) to prevent crash when the `??` operator preserves an explicit `false` for `replace`, bypassing the `!fromState` null guard and reaching `fromState.path` with `undefined`.

- [#443](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/pull/443) [`7801bad`](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/commit/7801bad69d20728a0816f4d84c42cb8fbcf30a97) Thanks [@greydragon888](https://github.com/greydragon888)! - Add `@real-router/internal-source` export condition for monorepo-internal src resolution ([#431](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/431))

  A new scoped export condition `@real-router/internal-source` is added to the package exports. Monorepo-internal TypeScript checking (via `tsconfig.json` `customConditions`) and Vitest (via the `workspaceSourceAliases` helper) now resolve `@real-router/*` imports to their `src/*.ts` files directly — no `dist/` artifacts required.

  External consumers (Vite, Webpack, Node.js) don't recognize this scoped condition name, so they continue to resolve via `import` / `require` → `dist/` exactly as before. The `@real-router/internal-source` entry is invisible to non-monorepo tools and doesn't change published package behavior.

  This structurally eliminates the race condition that caused flaky CI type-checks ([#431](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/431)) and makes the monorepo resilient to incomplete `.d.ts` generation from tsdown + rolldown RC ([#425](https://github.com/greydragon888/real-router/issues/425)).

  Internal refactor: `browser-env` infrastructure (tsdown config, package.json exports, docs) has been removed. Shared browser API abstractions now live as bare source files in `shared/browser-env/`, accessed through a git-tracked `src/browser-env` symlink inside this package. Imports use local paths (`./browser-env/index.js`). `type-guards` added to devDependencies (previously transitive via browser-env). No API changes, no bundle size difference — end users see no change.
