Add `router.dispose()` for permanent router termination

New method that permanently terminates the router. Unlike `stop()`, a disposed router cannot be restarted. All mutating methods throw `RouterError(ROUTER_DISPOSED)` after disposal. Read-only methods (`getState`, `isActive`, `getOptions`, `buildPath`) remain functional. Idempotent — safe to call multiple times.
