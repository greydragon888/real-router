Deduplicate all source implementations via `BaseSource` composition (#287)

Replaced all 4 wrapper classes (`RouteSource`, `RouteNodeSource`, `ActiveRouteSource`, `TransitionSource`) with factory functions that compose `BaseSource` directly. Added `onFirstSubscribe`/`onLastUnsubscribe`/`onDestroy` lifecycle hooks and auto-bound methods to `BaseSource`, eliminating all jscpd-reported code clones in the package.
