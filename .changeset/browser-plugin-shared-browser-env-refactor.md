Replace `browser-env` workspace package with symlinked shared sources (#437)

Internal refactor: `browser-env` infrastructure (tsdown config, package.json exports, docs) has been removed. Shared browser API abstractions now live as bare source files in `shared/browser-env/`, accessed through a git-tracked `src/browser-env` symlink inside this package. Imports use local paths (`./browser-env/index.js`). No API changes, no bundle size difference — end users see no change.
