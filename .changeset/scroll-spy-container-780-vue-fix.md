Fix scroll-spy `scrollContainer` pinned at creation — late-mounted/changed containers now honoured (#780)

`createScrollSpy`'s `scrollContainer` getter resolved the `IntersectionObserver` root and `MutationObserver` target **once at construction**, despite the option doc claiming resolution "on every event". A container that mounted after the spy was created — the canonical "scroll-spy on a separate route" config, and **always** the case under Angular (the spy is wired at bootstrap, before any component renders) — was never picked up: `root` stayed at the window viewport forever, so the spy computed the active zone against the wrong geometry and wrote the wrong hash to the URL.

`reconcile()` now compares the resolved container against the one the current observer pair was built with; on a change it rebuilds the `IntersectionObserver` (new root) and re-points the `MutationObserver` (new target), re-scanning anchors under the new scope. The getter is consulted at creation and re-consulted on every reconcile (DOM mutation), so late-mounted and swapped containers are honoured.
