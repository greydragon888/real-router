Fix scroll restoration writing a foreign position when two navigations land in one frame (#782)

`createScrollRestoration` captures the `previousRoute` scroll position synchronously inside `router.subscribe`, but the snap/restore effect runs a frame later in `requestAnimationFrame`. When two navigations commit in the same frame (`await router.navigate(b); await router.navigate(c)` — a typical programmatic redirect under optimistic sync), the second `subscribe` ran before the first navigation's rAF snapped the viewport to the top, so it read the position of the route **before** `previousRoute` and stored it under `previousRoute`'s key — overwriting `previousRoute`'s honest value. A later back to that route then landed at the wrong position.

A `scrollSettled` flag now marks the window between `TRANSITION_SUCCESS` and the matching rAF as unsettled; capture is skipped while unsettled, so `previousRoute`'s previously-stored position survives the transit. A genuine user scroll captured in that sub-frame window is physically impossible, so nothing real is lost.
