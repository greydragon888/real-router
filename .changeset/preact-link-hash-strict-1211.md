Strictly-decoded `<Link hash>` fragment (#1211) — the copy-from-`location.hash` tolerance (E.1) is removed

`encodeFragmentInline` (the `<Link hash>` fallback-path encoder, used when no URL plugin is present) previously probed for a percent escape and decode+re-encoded it (audit E.1 — "realistic consumers paste hashes out of `location.hash`"). It is now the trivial `encodeURI(s).replace(/#/g, "%23")` — byte-identical to the plugin layer's `encodeHashFragment`, obeying one strict contract. `<Link hash="a%20b">` renders `#a%2520b` (the literal fragment `a%20b`), not `#a%20b`. **Breaking** for consumers who passed raw, percent-encoded `location.hash` — pass a decoded fragment (`hash="a b"`). Part of the wave-2 hash cluster FORM axis.
