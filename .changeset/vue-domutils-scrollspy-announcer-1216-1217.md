Fix two `shared/dom-utils` regressions that ship into this adapter (#1216, #1217)

- **#1216 (scroll-spy):** the container-scoped `MutationObserver` cannot observe its own container's removal (a mutation of the container's parent), so a remounted scroll container was never re-observed. The router-subscribe callback now re-resolves + re-observes on navigation when the tracked container has detached — navigation is exactly when route-tied containers mount/die. Preserves the #780 container-scoped observation.
- **#1217 (route-announcer):** the shared `aria-live` element + ref-count were not scoped to a generation, so after a host wiped the element without calling `destroy()`, a stale instance's `destroy()` removed the newly-created element (deleted by selector) and drove the ref-count negative. A generation token now gates each instance's teardown, and removal uses the captured element ref.
