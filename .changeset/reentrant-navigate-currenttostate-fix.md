Fix reentrant `navigate()` in event listener wiping `#currentToState` (#308)

`sendComplete()`, `sendFail()`, and `sendCancel()` now use reentrancy-aware cleanup: `#currentToState` is only cleared if no reentrant `navigate()` set a new value during `fsm.send()`. Prevents `undefined` being passed as `toState` to `TRANSITION_CANCEL` listeners when `router.stop()` is called after a reentrant navigation with async guards.
